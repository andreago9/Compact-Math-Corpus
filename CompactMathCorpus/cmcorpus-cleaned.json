    "It\nhas been a pleasure to work with them.\n",
    "Robert Beezer encouraged me to make Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications avail-\nable as an open source textbook, a decision that I have never regretted.",
    "With his assistance,\nthe book has been rewritten in PreTeXt (pretextbook.org1), making it possible to quickly\noutput print, web, pdf versions and more from the same source.",
    "The open source version\nof this book has received support from the National Science Foundation (Awards #DUE-\n1020957, #DUE1625223, and #DUE1821329).\n",
    "1pretextbook.org\niv\n\nPreface\nThis text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra.\n",
    "Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields.\n",
    "However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that\ninvolve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important,\nand many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in\nmathematics.",
    "Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra\nand no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the\nimportance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown significantly.\n",
    "Until recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications.",
    "However,\none of the major problems in teaching an abstract algebra course is that for many students it\nis their first encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs.",
    "Such\nstudents often find it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions;\napplied examples help the instructor provide motivation.\n",
    "This text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester.\n",
    "Certainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however,\nfor a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a\nuseful text.",
    "The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and finally\nfields.",
    "Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications.",
    "A typical one-semester\ncourse might cover groups and rings while briefly touching on field theory, using Chapters 1\nthrough 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 (the first part), 16, 17, 18 (the first part), 20, and 21.",
    "Parts of\nthese chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of\nthe students and the instructor.",
    "A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover\nChapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 through 18, 20, 21, 22 (the first part), and 23.",
    "On\nthe other hand, if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 1\nthrough 14, and 16 through 22.",
    "In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results\ncould be assumed or omitted.",
    "A chapter dependency chart appears below.",
    "(A broken line\nindicates a partial dependency.)\nv\n\nvi\nChapters 16\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 7\nChapter 10\nChapter 11\nChapter 13\nChapter 16\nChapter 12\nChapter 14\nChapter 17\nChapter 15\nChapter 18\nChapter 20\nChapter 19\nChapter 21\nChapter 22\nChapter 23\nThough there are no specific prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students\nwho have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared\nthan those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication.\n",
    "Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an\nelementary knowledge of matrices and determinants.",
    "This should present no great problem,\nsince most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices\nand determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore or\njunior-level course in linear algebra.\n",
    "Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text.",
    "An exercise set appears at the\nend of each chapter.",
    "The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computa-\ntional, conceptual, and theoretical problems are included.",
    "A section presenting hints and\nsolutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text.",
    "Often in the solutions\na proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details.",
    "The exercises\nrange in diiculty from very easy to very challenging.",
    "Many of the more substantial prob-\nlems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the solution is not\nforthcoming after a few minutes of work.\n",
    "Ideally, students should read the relavent material before attending class.",
    "Reading ques-\ntions have been added to each chapter before the exercises.",
    "To prepare for class, students\n\nvii\nshould read the chapter before class and then answer the sections reading questions to\nprepare for the class.\n",
    "There are additional exercises or computer projects at the ends of many of the chapters.\n",
    "The computer projects usually require a knowledge of programming.",
    "All of these exercises\nand projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and\ntheory.\n",
    "Sage (sagemath.org2) is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics,\nwhich is ideal for assisting with a study of abstract algebra.",
    "Sage can be used either on\nyour own computer, a local server, or on CoCalc (cocalc.com3).",
    "Robert Beezer has written\na comprehensive introduction to Sage and a selection of relevant exercises that appear at\nthe end of each chapter, including live Sage cells in the web version of the book.",
    "All of the\nSage code has been subject to automated tests of accuracy, using the most recent version\navailable at this time: SageMath Version 9.6 (released 2022-05-15).\n",

    "After\nattending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school.",
    "In 1862 he obtained a temporary\nappointment at Christiania University.",
    "Even though his appointment was relatively brief,\nhe influenced students such as Sophus Lie (18421899).",
    "Sylow had a chance at a permanent\nchair in 1869, but failed to obtain the appointment.",
    "In 1872, he published a 10-page paper\npresenting the theorems that now bear his name.",
    "Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a\nnew edition of Abels works.",
    "In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created\nfor Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie.",
    "Sylow died in 1918.\n",
    "15.2 Examples and Applications\nExample 15.9 Using the Sylow Theorems, we can determine that A5 has subgroups of\norders 2, 3, 4, and 5.",
    "The Sylow p-subgroups of A5 have orders 3, 4, and 5.",
    "The Third\nSylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow p-subgroups A5 has.",
    "Since the number of\nSylow 5-subgroups must divide 60 and also be congruent to 1 (mod 5), there are either one\nor six Sylow 5-subgroups in A5.",
    "All Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate.",
    "If there were only\na single Sylow 5-subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal\nsubgroup of A5.",
    "Since A5 has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have\ndetermined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of A5.\n",
    "\nThe Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups.",
    "By\nusing them, we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain\nhypotheses are satisfied.\n",
    "Theorem 15.10 If p and q are distinct primes with p < q, then every group G of order\npq has a single subgroup of order q",
    "and this subgroup is normal in G. Hence, G cannot be\nsimple.",
    "Furthermore, if q 1 (mod p), then G is cyclic.\n",
    "We know that G contains a subgroup H of order q.",
    "The number of conjugates of\nH divides pq and is equal to 1 + kq for k",
    "= 0, 1, . .",
    "However, 1 + q is already too large to\ndivide the order of the group; hence, H can only be conjugate to itself.",
    "That is, H must be\nnormal in G.\n",
    "The group G also has a Sylow p-subgroup, say K. The number of conjugates of K must\ndivide q and be equal to 1 + kp for k = 0, 1, . .",
    "Since q is prime, either 1 + kp = q or\n1 + kp = 1.",
    "If 1 + kp = 1, then K is normal in G.",
    "In this case, we can easily show that G\nsatisfies the criteria, given in Chapter 9, for the internal direct product of H and K. Since\nH is isomorphic to Zq and K is isomorphic to Zp, G = Zp ",
    "Zq = Zpq by Theorem 9.21.\n",
    "\nExample 15.11 Every group of order 15 is cyclic.",
    "This is true because 15 = 53 and 5 1\n(mod 3).\n",
    "\nExample 15.12 Let us classify all of the groups of order 99 = 32  11 up to isomorphism.\n",
    "First we will show that every group G of order 99 is abelian.",
    "By the Third Sylow Theorem,\nthere are 1 + 3k Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, for some k = 0, 1, 2, . .",
    "Also, 1 + 3k\nmust divide 11; hence, there can only be a single normal Sylow 3-subgroup H in G. Similarly,\nthere are 1+11k Sylow 11-subgroups and 1+11k must divide 9.",
    "Consequently, there is only\none Sylow 11-subgroup K in G. By Corollary 14.16, any group of order p2 is abelian for p\nprime; hence, H is isomorphic either to Z3 ",
    "Z3 or to Z9.",
    "Since K has order 11, it must\nbe isomorphic to Z11.",
    "Therefore, the only possible groups of order 99 are Z3  Z3 ",
    "Z11 or\nZ9  Z11 up to isomorphism.\n",
    "\nTo determine all of the groups of order 5  7  47 = 1645, we need the following theorem.\n\n",
    "THE SYLOW THEOREMS\n185\nTheorem 15.13 Let G = aba1b1 : a, b Gbe the subgroup consisting of all finite\nproducts of elements of the form aba1b1 in a group",
    "G. Then G is a normal subgroup of\nG and G/G is abelian.\n",
    "The subgroup G of G is called the commutator subgroup of G.",
    "We leave the proof of\nthis theorem as an exercise (Exercise 10.4.14 in Chapter 10).\n",
    "Example 15.14 We will now show that every group of order 5747",
    "= 1645 is abelian, and\ncyclic by Theorem 9.21.",
    "By the Third Sylow Theorem, G has only one subgroup H1 of order\n47.",
    "So G/H1 has order 35 and must be abelian by Theorem 15.10.",
    "Hence, the commutator\nsubgroup of G is contained in H which tells us that |G| is either 1 or 47.",
    "If |G| = 1, we\nare done.",
    "Suppose that |G| = 47.",
    "The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that G has only one\nsubgroup of order 5 and one subgroup of order 7.",
    "So there exist normal subgroups H2 and\nH3 in G, where |H2| = 5 and |H3| = 7.",
    "In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence,\nG must be a subgroup of Hi, i = 1, 2.",
    "Therefore, the order of G is 1, 5, or 7.",
    "However, we\nalready have determined that |G| = 1 or 47.",
    "So the commutator subgroup of G is trivial,\nand consequently G is abelian.\n",
    "\nFinite Simple Groups\nGiven a finite group, one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups.\n",
    "Recall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups.",
    "As in the\ncase of A5, proving a group to be simple can be a very diicult task; however, the Sylow\nTheorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple.",
    "Usually, some sort of\ncounting argument is involved.\n",
    "Example 15.15 Let us show that no group G of order 20 can be simple.",
    "By the Third\nSylow Theorem, G contains one or more Sylow 5-subgroups.",
    "The number of such subgroups\nis congruent to 1 (mod 5) and must also divide 20.",
    "The only possible such number is 1.\n",
    "Since there is only a single Sylow 5-subgroup and all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate, this\nsubgroup must be normal.\n",
    "\nExample 15.16 Let G be a finite group of order pn, n > 1 and p prime.",
    "By Theorem 14.15,\nG has a nontrivial center.",
    "Since the center of any group G is a normal subgroup, G cannot\nbe a simple group.",
    "Therefore, groups of orders 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 49, 64, and 81 are not\nsimple.",
    "In fact, the groups of order 4, 9, 25, and 49 are abelian by Corollary 14.16.\n",
    "\nExample 15.17",
    "No group of order 56 = 23  7 is simple.",
    "We have seen that if we can show\nthat there is only one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing 56, then this must be a\nnormal subgroup and we are done.",
    "By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are either one or\neight Sylow 7-subgroups.",
    "If there is only a single Sylow 7-subgroup, then it must be normal.\n",
    "On the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow 7-subgroups.",
    "Then each of these\nsubgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains\nonly the identity of the group.",
    "This leaves 8  6 = 48 distinct elements in the group, each\nof order 7.\n",
    "Now let us count Sylow 2-subgroups.\n",
    "There are either one or seven Sylow\n2-subgroups.",
    "Any element of a Sylow 2-subgroup other than the identity must have as its\norder a power of 2; and therefore cannot be one of the 48 elements of order 7 in the Sylow\n7-subgroups.",
    "Since a Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, there is only enough room for a single\nSylow 2-subgroup in a group of order 56.",
    "If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be\nnormal.\n",
    "\nFor other groups G, it is more diicult to prove that G is not simple.",
    "Suppose G has\norder 48.",
    "In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work.\n",
    "We need the following lemma to prove that no group of order 48 is simple.\n\n",
    "THE SYLOW THEOREMS\n186\nLemma 15.18 Let H and K be finite subgroups of a group G. Then\n|HK| = |H|  |K|\n|H K| .\nProof.",
    "Recall that\nHK = {hk : h H, k K}.\n",
    "Certainly, |HK| |H|  |K| since some element in HK could be written as the product of\ndifferent elements in H and K.",
    "It is quite possible that h1k1 = h2k2 for h1, h2 H and\nk1, k2 K.",
    "If this is the case, let\na = (h1)1h2 = k1(k2)1.\n",
    "Notice that a H K, since (h1)1h2 is in H and k2(k1)1 is in K; consequently,\nh2 = h1a1\nk2 = ak1.\n",
    "Conversely, let h = h1b1 and k = bk1 for b H K.",
    "Then hk = h1k1, where h H\nand k K.",
    "Hence, any element hk HK can be written in the form hiki for hi H and\nki K, as many times as there are elements in H K; that is, |H K| times.",
    "Therefore,\n|HK| = (|H|  |K|)/|H K|.\n",
    "\nExample 15.19 To demonstrate that a group G of order 48 is not simple, we will show\nthat G contains either a normal subgroup of order 8 or a normal subgroup of order 16.",
    "By\nthe Third Sylow Theorem, G has either one or three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16.",
    "If there\nis only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup.\n",
    "Suppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow 2-subgroups are H and\n",
    "We claim that |H K| = 8.",
    "If |H K| 4, then by Lemma 15.18,\n|HK| 16  16\n4\n= 64,\nwhich is impossible.",
    "Notice that H K has index two in both of H and K, so is normal in\nboth, and thus H and K are each in the normalizer of H K. Because H is a subgroup of\nN(H K) and because N(H K) has strictly more than 16 elements, |N(H K)| must\nbe a multiple of 16 greater than 1, as well as dividing 48.\n",
    "The only possibility is that\n|N(H K)| = 48.",

    "Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously\ndonated from this source.\n",
    "Thanks go to the graduate students who have co-taught the Discrete Mathematics\ncourse with me over the years, including Evan Czysz, Alees Lee, and Sarah Sparks,\nwho helped develop new activities and exercises that have been incorporated into\nthis text.",
    "Michelle Morgan provided copy-editing support, and Jennifer Zakotnik-\nGutierrez helped code many of the interactive exercises in the online version of the\nbook.",
    "Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge, and Richard Grassl (again) for\ntheir suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.\n",
    "The online version of the book is written in PreTeXt and hosted on Runestone\nAcademy thanks to the tremendous development work of Rob Beezer, Brad Miller,\nDavid Farmer, and Alex Jordan along with the rest of the participants of the\npretext-support group1.\n",

    "This text aims to introduce select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate\nfor first- or second-year undergraduate math and computer science majors, especially\nthose who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics.",
    "The book began\nas a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern\nColorado.",
    "This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as\nthe bridge course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate introduction\nto proofs course.",
    "As this course has evolved to support our computer science\nmajor, so has the text.",
    "The current version of the book is intended to support\ninquiry-based teaching for understanding that is so crucial for future teachers,\nwhile also providing the necessary mathematical foundation and application-based\nmotivation for computer science students.",
    "While teaching the course in Spring\n2024 using an early version of this edition, I was pleasantly surprised by how many\nstudents reported that they, for the first time, saw how useful math could be in the\nreal world.",
    "I hope that this experience can be replicated in other classes using this\ntext.\n",
    "This book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem-oriented or\ninquiry-based methods.",
    "Each section begins with a preview of the content that\nincludes an open-ended Investigate!",
    "motivating question, as well as a structured\npreview activity.",
    "The preview activities are carefully scaffolded to provide an\nentry-point to the sections topic and to prime students to engage deeply in the\nmaterial.",
    "Depending on the pace of the class, I have found success assigning only\nthe section preview before class, using the preview activity as in-class group work,\nor assigning the entire section to be read before class (each section concludes with a\nsmall set of reading questions that can be assigned to encourage students to actually\nread).",
    "For those readers using this book for self-study, the organization of the\nsections will hopefully mimic the style of a rich inquiry-based classroom.\n",
    "The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I\nteach at UNC.",
    "The main areas of study are logic and proof, graph theory, combina-\ntorics, and sequences.",
    "Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences.\n",
    "Discrete structures are introduced as needed, but a more thorough treatment of\nsets and functions is included as a separate chapter, which can be studied indepen-\ndent of the other content.",
    "The final chapter covers two additional topics: generating\nfunctions and number theory.\n",
    "While I believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free\nto skip around to what interests you.",
    "There are occasionally examples and exercises\nthat rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum, and they\nusually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study.",
    "If\nyou are an instructor, you can also create a custom version by editing the PreTeXt\nsource to fit your needs.\n",
    "ix\n\nx\nImprovements to the 4th Edition.\n",
    "Many of the sections have been rewritten to\nimprove the clarity of the exposition.\n",
    " Nearly 300 new exercises, bringing the total to more than 750.",
    "These are better\ndivided into preview activity questions, reading questions, practice problems,\nand additional exercises.",
    "Most of the new exercises are interactive for the\nonline version.\n",
    " New sections on probability, relations, and discrete structures and their proofs.\n",
    "Some other sections have been split up to make it more likely that a single\nclass period can be devoted to a single topic.\n",
    " Improved presentation for the counting chapter with a focus on considering\nsets of outcomes more than following rules.\n",
    "activities of the 3rd Edition have been split into two types:\nInvestigate!",
    "questions and Preview Activities.",
    "The former are open-ended\nquestions designed to engage you with the topic soon to be discussed.",
    "The\nlatter are structured preview activities that you should be able to completely\nanswer before reading the section.\n",
    "The previous editions (3rd Edition, released in 2019, 2nd Edition, released in\n2016, and the Fall 2015 Edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use\nthose versions due to familiarity.\n",
    "I plan to continue improving the book.",
    "Some of this will happen in real-time\nby updating the online versions to include new content (numbering will remain\nconsistent).",
    "Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as\nyou have them.\n",
    "Oscar Levin, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Northern Colorado, 2024\n\nHow to Use This Book\nIn addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage\nyou to interact with the mathematics.\n",
    "Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very\nbeginning of a topic) you will find open-ended questions designed to engage you\nwith the topic soon to be discussed.",
    "You really should spend some time thinking\nabout, or even working through, these problems before reading the section.",
    "However,\ndont worry if you cannot find a satisfying solution right away.",
    "The goal is to pique\nyour interest, so you will read what is next looking for answers.\n",
    "Most sections include a structured preview activity.",
    "These\ncontain leading questions that you should be able to completely answer before\nreading the section.",
    "The idea is that the questions prime you to engage meaningfully\nwith the new content ahead.",
    "If you are using the online version, most of these\nquestions will provide you with immediate feedback so you can be confident moving\nforward.\n",
    "I have tried to include the correct number of examples.",
    "For those\nexamples that include problems, full solutions are included.",
    "Before reading the\nsolution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking.",
    "Unlike\nsome textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all-inclusive for problems you\nwill see in the exercises.",
    "They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other\nproblems.",
    "Instead, use the examples to deepen your understanding of the concepts\nand techniques discussed in each section.",
    "Then use this understanding to solve the\nexercises at the end of each section.\nExercises.\n",
    "You get good at math through practice.",
    "Each section concludes with\npractice problems meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that\nsection; the online version provides immediate feedback on these problems.",
    "There\nare then additional exercises that are more challenging and open-ended.",
    "These\nmight be assigned as written homework or used in class as group work.",
    "Some of the\nadditional exercises have hints or solutions in the back of the book, but use these\nas little as possible.",
    "Struggle is good for you.",
    "At the end of each chapter, a larger\ncollection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of chapter review) which might\nbridge the material of different sections in that chapter.\n",
    "Interactive Online Version.\n",
    "For those of you reading this in print or as a PDF, I\nencourage you to also check out the interactive online version.",
    "Many of the preview\nactivities and exercises are interactive and can give you immediate feedback.",
    "Some of\nxi\n\nxii\nthese have randomized components, allowing you to practice many similar versions\nof the same problems until you master the topic.\n",
    "Hints and solutions to examples are also hidden away behind an extra click to\nencourage you to think about the problem before reading the solution.",
    "There is a\ngood search feature available as well, and the index has expandable links to see the\ncontent without jumping to the page immediately.",
    "There is also a python scratch\npad (the pencil icon) so you can try out some code if you feel so inclined.\n",
    "Additional interactivity is planned.",
    "These bonus features will be added on a\nrolling basis, so keep an eye out!\n",

    "If this is your first time encountering the subject,\nyou will probably find discrete mathematics quite different from other math subjects.\n",

    "Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard.",
    "What is\nmathematics?",
    "The study of numbers?",
    "In part yes, but you also study functions and\nlines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . . . .",
    "Or perhaps you want\nto say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems.\n",
    "What sort of problems?",
    "Well, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles,\n. . . .",
    "Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of\ndiscrete to it, as defined above.",
    "Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is\nindividually separate and distinct.\n",
    "In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers\n(perhaps they constitute the range of a function).",
    "You would represent this set as an\ninterval: [0, ) is the range of () = 2 since the set of outputs of the function are\nall real numbers 0 and greater.",
    "This set of numbers is NOT discrete.",
    "The numbers in\nthe set are not separated by much at all.",
    "In fact, take any two numbers in the set and\nthere are infinitely many more between them that are also in the set.\n",
    "Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would\nnot be an interval.",
    "Consider the function that gives the number of children of\neach person reading this.",
    "What is the range?",
    "Im guessing it is something like\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.",
    "Maybe 5 or 6 is in there too.1",
    "But certainly nobody reading this has\n1.32419 children.",
    "This output set is discrete because the elements are separate.",
    "The\ninputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual\nperson.\n",
    "There are many discrete mathematical objects besides sets of numbers; we will\nintroduce some of these in Section 0.2.",

    "However, the reason we want to study\nthese structures is because they provide a way to model real-world problems.2\nTo get a feel for the subject, lets consider the types of problems you solve in\ndiscrete math.",
    "Here are a few simple examples:\nInvestigate!\n",

    "The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for\nall of his friends.",
    "To kick things off, they decide that everyone should\nshake hands.",
    "Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands\nwith every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once,\nhow many handshakes take place?\n",
    "At the warm-up event for Oscars All-Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al\nate one hot dog.",

    "How many hot\ndogs were eaten in total?\n3.",
    "After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber.\n",
    "The room is empty except for two large chests.",
    "On each is carved a\nmessage (strangely in English):\nExactly one of these\nchests contains a treasure,\nwhile the other is filled with\ndeadly immortal scorpions.\n",
    "For either chest, if the\nchests message is true, then\nthe chest contains treasure.\n",
    "The problem is, you dont know whether the messages are true or\nfalse.",
    "What do you do?\n",
    "Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to\nbuild roads directly connecting each pair of towns.",
    "While the towns\nhad plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they\nwished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each\nother (as stop signs had not yet been invented).",
    "Also, tunnels and\nbridges were not allowed, for moral reasons.",
    "Is it possible for each of\nthese towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without\ncreating any intersections?\n2Many of the problems discussed in this book are admittedly contrived and clearly fictional, but\nhopefully you will see how these toy problems can be generalized to actually represent problems that\npeople would care about in reality.\n\n0.1.",
    "What is Discrete Mathematics?\n3\nAs you consider the problems above, dont worry if it is not obvious to you\nwhat the solutions are.",
    "We are more interested here in what sort of information we\nneed to be able to answer the questions.",
    "How can we represent the situation using\nindividually separate and distinct objects?",
    "Dont read on until you have thought\nabout at least this for each of the questions.\n",
    "Here are some things you might have thought about:\n1.",
    "The people at the party are individuals.",
    "We can consider the set of people.",
    "We\ncan also consider sets of pairs of people, since it takes exactly two people to\nshake hands.",
    "So the question is really, how many pairs can you make using\nelements from a 10-element set?\n",
    "For example, if there were three people at the party, conveniently named 1, 2,\nand 3, then the pairs would be (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).",
    "Or should we include\n(2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2) as well?\n2.",
    "To count the number of hot dogs eaten, either by an individual or in total,\nwe could use a sequence of integers (whole numbers).",
    "The th term in the\nsequence might represent the number of hot dogs eaten by the th contestant.\n",
    "We can consider a second sequence, also of integers, that gives the total number\nof hot dogs eaten by the first contestants combined.\n",
    "The solution to the problem will then be the value of the 26th term in the\nsequence.",
    "To help us find this, we could consider the rate of growth of the\nsequences, as well as how these two sequences relate to each other.\n",
    "3. Logic questions also belong under the discrete math umbrella: Each statement\ncan have a value of True or False (and there is nothing in-between).",
    "To answer\nquestions like that of the chests of scorpions, we must understand the structure\nof the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements\ninteract to determine the truth value of the whole statement.\n",
    "The last question is about a discrete structure called a graph, not to be confused\nwith a graph of a function or set of points.",
    "We can use a graph to represent\nwhich elements of a set (or towns) are related to each other (or connected by\na road).",
    "In this case, the question becomes, can we draw a graph with five\nvertices (towns) and ten edges (roads) such that no two edges intersect?\n",
    "The four problems above illustrate the four main topics of this book: combina-\ntorics (the theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways),\nsequences, symbolic logic, and graph theory.",
    "However, there are other topics\nthat are also considered part of discrete mathematics, including computer science,\nabstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of\nthese, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).\n",
    "Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do it.",
    "Lets get\nstarted!",
    "Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we\nwill consider a very brief overview of the types of discrete structures we will be\nusing.\n\n4\n0.",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\nReading Questions\nEach section of the book will end with a small number of Reading Questions like\nthe ones below.",
    "These are designed to help you reflect on what you have read.",
    "In\nparticular, the final reading question asks you to ask a question of your own.",
    "Thinking\nabout what you dont yet know is a wonderful way to further your understanding of\nwhat you do.\n",
    "Right now, how would you describe what discrete mathematics is about, if\nyou were telling your friends about the class you are in?",

    "You do not need to find a complete\nsolution, but you should describe what you could try and what you think you\nmight need to do to find a solution.\n",
    "We are taking a problem-solving approach to discrete mathematics: We will\nconsider a large variety of questions that have a discrete feel to them, and consider\nhow to answer those questions (and prove that our answers are correct).",
    "This is not\nthe only way to study discrete math.",
    "Another approach would be to study the tools\nused to solve the problems.",
    "If we were art students, we could study paintbrushes\nand easels and the composition of paint, which would be interesting for sure, but I\nthink it is more enjoyable to actually paint those happy little trees.\n",

    "They are the mathematical\nobjects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving.",
    "Structure\nis a good word here, since these things have fairly rigid constraints that make\nthem what they are, just like an apartment building is going to have different\ncharacteristics than an airplane hangar or a suspension bridge (these are types of\nphysical structures, not mathematical structures, just to be overly clear and destroy\nthe metaphor).\n",
    "The structures we will use most in discrete math are sets, functions, sequences,\nrelations, and graphs.",

    "As we progress\nthrough our studies, each will be explored in more detail.\n",
    "0.2.2\nSets\nA set is an unordered collection of elements.",
    "This is fairly vague, but unless we\nwant to spend a whole book trying to understand sets more precisely, it will be\ngood enough for us.",
    "It is possible to define all of mathematics using just sets (even\n5\n\n6\n0.",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\nnumbers can be thought of as sets themselves), but this is also not what we will do.\n",
    "Rather, we want to be able to talk about collections of numbers and other objects,\nand we will collect them in something we call a set.\n",
    "We can describe sets by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.",
    "We\ncould specify this membership in words (e.g., Let be the set of all natural numbers\nless than 10), or by explicitly listing all the elements (e.g., = {3, 5, 7}), or using\nsomething called set comprehension (also called set builder notation).",
    "An example\nof this is = {: < 10}.",
    "We would read that as is the set of natural\nnumbers that satisfy the property that they are less than 10.",
    "More precisely, the \nsymbol represents the natural numbers, which is itself a set: = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}",
    "(this\nshows another way to describe a set).",
    "The symbol means is an element of.",
    "The :\nis read such that and tells us that what comes next is the condition that must be\ntrue of the sets elements.\n",
    "By the way...",
    "In this book, we define the natural numbers to be the whole\nnumbers starting with 0.",
    "Not every book includes 0 in this set.",
    "It largely\ndepends on what area of mathematics you study.\n",
    "Since there are multiple ways to describe the same set, we should be careful\nabout what it means for sets to be the same or different.",
    "A set is determined by its\nmembership, so all four of the following describe exactly the same set:\n1.",

    "4. {: < 5 and 1}.\n",
    "There are lots of things you can do with sets, which we will consider in more\ndetail as we need to.",
    "We will see that it is often helpful to build new sets from\nones we already have (by taking the union or intersection of sets, for example), to\ncompare sets (asking if one set is a subset of another), and to find the number of\nelements of a set (called its cardinality).",
    "We might also want to match up elements\nof one set with another: To do this, we might use a function, which we will discuss\nnext.",
    "Awesomely, we can also use sets themselves to describe functions.",
    "Lets check\nit out.\n",
    "One way to define a function is as a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.\n",
    "The output is called the image of the input.",
    "Functions also come equipped with a\ndomain, the set of all inputs, and a codomain, the set of all allowable outputs.",
    "You\nmight also speak of the range of the function, which is the set of all actual outputs,\nor put another way, the set of all images of elements from the domain.\n\n",
    "Discrete Structures\n7\nWe write : to describe a function with name , domain and codomain\n.",
    "This does not tell us which function is though.",
    "To define the function, we must\ndescribe the rule.",
    "Often this is done with a formula (for example, () = 2 says\nthat each element of the domain is mapped to its square), or in words (like how we\njust described the squaring function).",
    "We could also define a function with a table\nor a graph.\n",
    "The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for\neach input.",
    "That is, the rule must be a good rule.",
    "What output do we assign to the\ninput 7?",
    "There can only be one answer for any particular function.\n",
    "Since a function maps one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain), there\nis an obvious connection between sets and functions.",
    "There is another connection\nworth considering though: The graph of a function is often described as a set of\npoints.",
    "Here is an example.\n",
    "Example 0.2.2\nConsider the function : {1, 2, 3} {2, 4, 6} defined by () =",
    "If we\nwanted to plot a graph of this function, we would draw the points (1, 2), (2, 4),\nand (3, 6) (but we would not connect these points with lines, since we are\nstudying discrete math; the domain only contains three elements, not the\ninfinitely many between them).\n",
    "So associated with the function is the set of points {(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)}.",
    "In\nfact, this set of points is associated exactly with this (and only this) function.\n",
    "So we can think of this set of points as the function itself.\n",
    "Of course, we are using a mathematical object here: an ordered pair.",
    "This is not\na set (since sets are unordered).",
    "How should we talk about ordered things?",
    "We will\ntake this question up in the next section.\n",
    "There is one more important consideration about how we define a function with\na rule.",
    "A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule\nbased solely on its input.",
    "This is what most of us think of as a formula.",
    "For example,\n() = 3+ 1 is a closed formula, since to find (5) (say) we take the input 5 and do\nsomething to it:",
    "Multiply it by 5 and then add 1.\n",
    "What else could a formula possibly be?",
    "A recursive definition of a function tells\nus how to compute the output for a given input based on other outputs of the function.\n",
    "For example, we might insist that () = 2  (1).",
    "If we also specify an initial\ncondition that (0) = 3, then we can find (1) = 2  3 = 6, and then (2) = 2  6 = 12,\nand so on.",
    "What is (5) here?",
    "The only way to answer that is to find (4), which\nmeans we need to find (3), which we could do, since we have computed (2).\n",
    "Recursive definitions of functions might be less useful for finding a particular\noutput, but they are often easier to specify for a particular application.",
    "We will\nexplore this phenomenon more when we study sequences.",
    "Speaking of which...\n\n8\n0.",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\n0.2.4\nSequences\nSometimes we are interested not just in a collection of numbers, but in what order\nthose numbers appear.",
    "In such cases, we cannot use sets, since they do not distinguish\nbetween the order of their elements.",
    "Instead, we consider sequences.\n",
    "We will consider both finite and infinite sequences.",
    "A finite sequence may be\nsomething as simple as (1, 2, 3); that is a sequence with 3 elements, in that particular\norder.",
    "We might also call this an ordered triple, the same way that (7, 3) is an\nordered pair.",
    "In general, we could call this an -tuple if it has elements (we assume\nthat tuples are ordered).\n",
    "The key difference between the sequence (1, 2, 3) and the set {1, 2, 3} is that we\ncare about the order.",
    "That is, the sequence (1, 2, 3) is different from the sequence\n(2, 3, 1), while the set {1, 2, 3} is identical to {2, 3, 1}.\n",
    "We will often use sequences as a counting tool.",
    "For example, a very simple\ncounting question is, How many wheels do 100 cars have?",
    "Instead of answering\njust this one question, we could generalize and ask how many wheels cars have,\nand get a sequence of answers.",
    "This yields the infinite sequence (4, 8, 12, . . .).",
    "The\norder these multiples of 4 appear in is important, since each number in the sequence\ncorresponds to a specific version of the question.\n",
    "It is fine to think of a sequence of numbers as an ordered list.",
    "We can refer to the\nterms simply as\n0, 1, 2, . . .\nand might refer to the entire sequence as ()0 or ().\nIf we want to be a little more precise and more abstract, we can think of a sequence\nas a function.",
    "The domain is the natural numbers or some subset of consecutive\nnatural numbers (like {1, 2, 3, 4}).",
    "The codomain is some set.",
    "We think of the domain\nas the positions in the sequence, and the image of those inputs as the terms in the\nsequence.\n",
    "For example, we might consider the Fibonacci sequence ( )1, which starts\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . .",
    "What is the 4th term in the sequence?",
    "We might say 4 = 3 (this is\nassuming the first 1 is the first term and not the 0th term).",
    "Note that there can only\nbe one 4th term.",
    "There can only be one -th term for any particular value of . So\nfor any input (the position of the term), there is only one output (the term).",
    "It would\nbe perfectly reasonable to write (4)",
    "= 3, and that really does look like a function.\n",
    "But we like to use subscripts.\n",
    "We can also describe the terms in a sequence using a table.",
    "We might write\nsomething like the following:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n...\n\n1\n3\n6\n10\n...\n",
    "This looks exactly like how you would represent a function, even though this table\ndescribes the sequence of triangular numbers (we will see why they are called this\nlater).\n",
    "Since sequences are functions, we can use any of the techniques to describe\nfunctions to describe sequences.",
    "In particular, we might give a closed formula for a\n\n0.2.",
    "Discrete Structures\n9\nsequence by explicitly giving the function for the -th term.",
    "For example,\n= (+ 1)\n2\n.\n",
    "Alternatively, we could define a sequence recursively by saying how to get from\none term to the next.",
    "This is especially useful for the Fibonacci sequence:\n= 1 + 2; 1 = 1, 2 = 1.\n",
    "Much of our effort in understanding sequences will go into taking a recursive\ndefinition and finding a closed formula for the sequence.",
    "We will study this, and\neverything else sequence related in Chapter 4.\n0.2.5\nRelations\nHow are the numbers 2 and 6 related?",
    "Oh, I know: 2 < 6.",
    "Also, 6 is a multiple of 2.\n",
    "The two numbers are also both even.",
    "And here is another fact: They are not equal.\n",
    "All four of these are examples of relations: less than, multiple of, both even, not\nequal.",
    "And there are many more (infinitely many) relations for pairs of numbers.\n",
    "The examples above are all binary relations in that they relate two elements.\n",
    "You could also consider relations between more than two elements.",
    "For example,\nwe could consider the relation Pythagorean triple on three numbers that holds\nprecisely if they are the side lengths of a right triangle.",
    "So the relation is true of the\ntriple (3, 4, 5), but not of (4, 5, 6) (since 32 + 42 = 52, but 42 + 52 62).\n",
    "Notice that we can talk about a pair or triple satisfying a relation.",
    "We might say\nthat a pair belongs to the relation.",
    "The careful and formal way to define a relation is\nas a set of ordered pairs (or triples, etc.).",
    "Consider the (infinite) set of all ordered\npairs (, ) such that < . Every element of this set contains numbers for which\nthe relation less than is true, and every pair of numbers for which the relation is\ntrue is a pair in the set.",
    "So we can say that this set of pairs is the relation.\n",
    "Relations can have some standard properties, and deciding whether a particular\nrelation has a given property can often help us understand the relation better.",
    "The\nless-than relation is, for example, irreflexive because there are no elements that are\nless than themselves.",
    "It is also antisymmetric since there are no distinct numbers \nand such that < and < .",
    "It is also transitive since if < and <",
    "then it\nmust follow that < .",
    "These are just a few examples of relation properties though.\n",
    "Why would we care about these properties?",
    "It turns out that some groups of\nproperties happen together frequently, and for such collections of properties, we\ncan prove general results about the relations that satisfy them.",
    "So if we can prove\nthat a given relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (whatever those mean),\nthen we know the relation is an equivalence relation, and therefore we know it\nhas a bunch of other properties.",
    "A large portion of discrete mathematics is about\nstudying particular types of relations.",
    "One of my favorites is a relation that gives us\na graph.\n\n",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\n0.2.6\nGraphs\nConsider the set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.",
    "Which pairs of numbers from that set add\nup to 7?",
    "We could have {1, 6} or {2, 5} or {3, 4}.",
    "We can picture the set and the\ninteresting (unordered) pairs (i.e., two-element subsets) as a picture called a graph:\n1\n6\n2\n5\n3\n4\nOn the other hand, we might want to consider pairs of numbers whose sum is\neven.",
    "Then, we would get the following picture.\n",
    "1\n5\n2\n6\n3\n4\nWe call these discrete structures graphs.",
    "A graph is a type of relation, one that is\nsymmetric (if is related to , then is related to ) and irreflexive (no element is\nrelated to itself).\n",
    "However, we mostly think of graphs as the drawings of dots and lines, or more\nprecisely as a set of vertices together with a set of edges, where each edge is a\ntwo-element subset of the vertices.",
    "Notice that even here, we are using the structure\nset to define the structure graph.\n",
    "Graphs show up in all sorts of real-world applications: In a class, some students\nare friends with each other, so take the students to be the vertices and the edges to be\nthe friendships.",
    "In geography, some countries share a border, so take the countries\nto be the vertices and connect a pair of vertices with an edge if the countries share a\nborder.",

    "So counting the elements in a set or counting the number of outcomes of an\nevent is not really different.",
    "Lets think of every counting problem as asking for the\nnumber of elements in a set of outcomes.\n",
    "At the most basic level, counting is not hard at all: Just write all the outcomes in\na numbered list and see how many numbers you use.",

    "Where counting begins to get interesting is when we want to make a new list\nthat combines two or more lists we have already counted.",
    "For example, suppose\nthat in addition to my list of four bow ties, I had a list of seven pairs of novelty socks.\n",
    "I could ask how many choices I have if I wanted to wear either a cool bow tie or a\npair of novelty socks.",
    "Okay, combine my two lists to make a new list with 11 items:\nPerhaps first list the four bow ties and then keep counting (starting with 5 for the\nfirst pair of socks) until you have listed the seven additional items, ending at 11.\n",
    "1Obviously this example is quite outdated; only four bow ties?",
    "What sort of mathematician do you\ntake me for?\n\n3.2.",
    "Combining Outcomes\n207\nIn this example, we have combined our two sets of outcomes (picking a bow tie\nand picking a pair of socks) to get a new set of outcomes (picking a bow tie or pair\nof socks).",

    "Surjective functions are not as easily counted (unless the size of the\ndomain is smaller than the codomain, in which case there are none).\n",
    "The idea is to count the functions that are not surjective, and then subtract that\nfrom the total number of functions.",

    "There are 25 functions total, two choices for where to send each\nof the 5 elements of the domain.",

    "A closed formula for a sequence ()is a formula for using a fixed\nfinite number of operations on . This is what you normally think of as a\nformula in , just as if you were defining a function in terms of (because\nthat is exactly what you are doing).\n",
    "Definition 4.1.4 Recursive definition.\n",
    "A recursive definition (sometimes called an inductive definition) for a\nsequence ()consists of a recurrence relation : an equation relating a\nterm of the sequence to previous terms (terms with smaller index), and an\ninitial condition: a list of a few terms of the sequence (one less than the\nnumber of terms in the recurrence relation).\n",
    "It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:\n\n4.1.",

    "You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences.\n",
    "After all, it is harder to find with a recursive definition than with a closed formula.\n",
    "This is true, but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to\nfind a recursive definition.",
    "So to find a useful closed formula, we might first find the\nrecursive definition, and then use that to find the closed formula.\n",

    "By actually computing these values, we see right away what the recurrence\nrelation is:\n= 21 + 1.\n",
    "This is justified because the problem the sequence is modeling says that we\ndouble the number of grains each day, and then add 1.",
    "We can read the\nrecurrence relation right off the problem.\n",
    "The original question asked about 30.",
    "We could find this using the\nrecurrence relation, but we would first need to find 29, and to find that we\nwould need 28, which requires 27 first, and so on.",

    "Preface\nThis book helps students to master the material of a standard US undergraduate\nrst course in Linear Algebra.\n",
    "The material is standard in that the subjects covered are Gaussian reduction,\nvector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "Another standard is the books audience: sophomores or juniors, usually with\na background of at least one semester of calculus.",
    "The help that it gives to\nstudents comes from taking a developmental approach  this books presentation\nemphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.\n",
    "The developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will\nelaborate.",
    "Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on\ntheory and more on calculating.",
    "Later courses ask for mathematical maturity: the\nability to follow dierent types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that\nunderlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and function\nfacts, and a capacity for some independent reading and thinking.",
    "Some programs\nhave a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear\nAlgebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition.",
    "It comes early in a\nprogram so that progress made here pays olater but it also comes late enough\nso that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.\n",
    "The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant.",
    "And, examples are plentiful.\n",
    "Helping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seri-\nously.",
    "All of the results here are proved.",
    "On the other hand, we cannot assume\nthat students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced\ntexts this book is lled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed\nillustrations.\n",
    "Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix\nmultiplication and determinants.",
    "Then, when vector spaces and linear maps\nnally appear and denitions and proofs start, the abrupt change brings the\n\nstudents to an abrupt stop.",
    "While this book begins with linear reduction, from\nthe start we do more than compute.",
    "The rst chapter includes proofs, such as\nthe proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set.",
    "With\nthat as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals.",
    "In the\nschedule below this happens at the start of the third week.\n",
    "A student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises.",
    "The problem\nsets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs.",
    "I\nhave aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection.",
    "In\nparticular there is a good number of the medium-dicult problems that stretch\na learner, but not too far.",
    "At the high end, there are a few that are puzzles taken\nfrom various journals, competitions, or problems collections, which are marked\nwith a ?",
    "(as part of the fun I have worked to keep the original wording).\n",
    "That is, as with the rest of the book, the exercises are aimed to both build\nan ability at, and help students experience the pleasure of, doing mathematics.\n",
    "Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to picture themselves\ndoing the same type of work.\n",
    "Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects of the\nsubject.",
    "Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of topics in those\nareas.",
