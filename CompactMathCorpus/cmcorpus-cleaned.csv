Preface
This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra.
"
9,"Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields.
"
10,"However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that
involve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important,
and many science, engine"
11,"Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra
and no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the
importance of applications s"
12,Until recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications.
13,"However,
one of the major problems in teaching an abstract algebra course is that for many students it
is their first encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs."
14,"Such
students often find it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions;
applied examples help the instructor provide motivation.
"
15,"This text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester.
"
16,"Certainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however,
for a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a
useful text."
17,"The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and finally
fields."
18,Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications.
19,"A typical one-semester
course might cover groups and rings while briefly touching on field theory, using Chapters 1
through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 (the first part), 16, 17, 18 (the first part), 20, and 21."
20,"Parts of
these chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of
the students and the instructor."
21,"A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover
Chapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 through 18, 20, 21, 22 (the first part), and 23."
22,"On
the other hand, if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 1
through 14, and 16 through 22."
23,"In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results
could be assumed or omitted."
24,A chapter dependency chart appears below.

indicates a partial dependency.)

26,"Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an
elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants."
27,"This should present no great problem,
since most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices
and determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already take"
28,Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text.
29,"An exercise set appears at the
end of each chapter."
30,"The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computa-
tional, conceptual, and theoretical problems are included."
31,"A section presenting hints and
solutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text."
32,"Often in the solutions
a proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details."
33,"The exercises
range in diiculty from very easy to very challenging."
34,"Many of the more substantial prob-
lems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the solution is not
forthcoming after a few minutes of work.
"
35,"Ideally, students should read the relavent material before attending class."
36,"Reading ques-
tions have been added to each chapter before the exercises."
37,"To prepare for class, students

vii
should read the chapter before class and then answer the sections reading questions to
prepare for the class.
"
38,"There are additional exercises or computer projects at the ends of many of the chapters.
"
39,The computer projects usually require a knowledge of programming.
40,"All of these exercises
and projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and
theory.
"
41,"Sage (sagemath.org2) is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics,
which is ideal for assisting with a study of abstract algebra."
42,"Sage can be used either on
your own computer, a local server, or on CoCalc (cocalc.com3)."
43,"Robert Beezer has written
a comprehensive introduction to Sage and a selection of relevant exercises that appear at
the end of each chapter, including live Sage cells in the web version of the book."
44,"All of the
Sage code has been subject to automated tests of accuracy, using the most recent version
available at this time: SageMath Version 9.6 (released 2022-05-15).

Preliminaries
A certain amount of mathematical maturity is nec"
192,"A basic knowledge of set theory, mathematical induction, equivalence
relations, and matrices is a must."
193,"Even more important is the ability to read and understand
mathematical proofs."
194,"In this chapter we will outline the background needed for a course in
abstract algebra.
"
195,"1.1 A Short Note on Proofs
Abstract mathematics is different from other sciences."
196,"In laboratory sciences such as chem-
istry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theo-
ries."
197,"Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer
simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments."
198,"In studying abstract
mathematics, we take what is called an axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection
of objects S and assume some rules about their structure."
199,"These rules are called axioms.
"
200,"Using the axioms for S, we wish to derive other information about S by using logical argu-
ments."
201,"We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one
another."
202,We also demand that there not be too many axioms.
203,"If a system of axioms is too
restrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.
"
204,A statement in logic or mathematics is an assertion that is either true or false.
205,"Consider
the following examples:
 3 + 56 13 + 8/2.
"
206,"All cats are black.
"
207," 2 + 3 = 5.
 2x"
208,"= 6 exactly when x = 4.
"
209,"If ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0, then
x = b 

b2 4ac
2a
.
"
210," x3 4x2 + 5x 6.
"
211,"All but the first and last examples are statements, and must be either true or false.
"
212,"A mathematical proof is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy
of a statement."
213,"Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience; for
1

CHAPTER 1."
214,"PRELIMINARIES
2
instance, we can see that the statement 2x = 6 exactly when x = 4 is false by evaluating
2  4 and noting that 6 = 8, an argument that would satisfy anyone."
215,"Of course, audiences
may vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the
reader of a text."
216,"If more detail than needed is presented in the proof, then the explanation
will be either long-winded or poorly written."
217,"If too much detail is omitted, then the proof
may not be convincing."
218,Again it is important to keep the audience in mind.
219,"High school
students require much more detail than do graduate students."
220,"A good rule of thumb for an
argument in an introductory abstract algebra course is that it should be written to convince
ones peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text."
221,Let us examine different types of statements.
222,"A statement could be as simple as 10/5 =
2; however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as If
p, then q, where p and q are both statements."
223,"If certain statements are known or assumed
to be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements."
224,"Here p is called
the hypothesis and q is known as the conclusion.
"
225,"Consider the following statement: If
ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0, then
x = b 

b2 4ac
2a
.
"
226,"The hypothesis is ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0; the conclusion is
x = b 

b2 4ac
2a
.
"
227,Notice that the statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true.
228,"How-
ever, if this entire statement is true and we can show that ax2 + bx + c"
229,"= 0 with a = 0 is
true, then the conclusion must be true."
230,"A proof of this statement might simply be a series
of equations:
ax2 + bx + c"
231,"= 0
x2 + b
ax = c
a
x2 + b
ax +

= b2 4ac
4a2
x + b
2a = 

b2 4ac
2a
x = b 

b2 4ac

.
"
232,"If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition."
233,"A propo-
sition of major importance is called a theorem."
234,"Sometimes instead of proving a theorem
or proposition all at once, we break the proof down into modules; that is, we prove several
supporting propositions, which are called lemmas, and use the results"
235,"If we can prove a proposition or a theorem, we will often, with
very little effort, be able to derive other related propositions called corollaries.
"
236,"Some Cautions and Suggestions
There are several different strategies for proving propositions."
237,"In addition to using different
methods of proof, students often make some common mistakes when they are first learning

CHAPTER 1."
238,"PRELIMINARIES

how to prove theorems."
239,"To aid students who are studying abstract mathematics for the
first time, we list here some of the diiculties that they may encounter and some of the
strategies of proof available to them."
240,"It is a good idea to keep referring back to this list as
a reminder."
241,"(Other techniques of proof will become apparent throughout this chapter and
the remainder of the text.)
"
242,"A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a
statement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample.
"
243,Quantifiers are important.
244,"Words and phrases such as only, for all, for every, and for
some possess different meanings.
"
245, Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem.
246,"You cannot
take things for granted.
"
247, Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique.
248,"First show that there
actually is such an object."
249,"To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such
objects, say r and s, and then show that r = s.
 Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement."
250,"Proving the state-
ment If p, then q is exactly the same as proving the statement If not q, then not
p.
"
251,"Although it is usually better to find a direct proof of a theorem, this task can some-
times be diicult."
252,"It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying
to prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to
make some statement that cannot possibly be true.
"
253,"Remember that one of the main objectives of higher mathematics is proving theorems.
"
254,Theorems are tools that make new and productive applications of mathematics possible.
255,"We
use examples to give insight into existing theorems and to foster intuitions as to what new
theorems might be true."
256,"Applications, examples, and proofs are tightly interconnected
much more so than they may seem at first appearance.
"
257,"1.2 Sets and Equivalence Relations
Set Theory
"
258,"A set is a well-defined collection of objects; that is, it is defined in such a manner that we
can determine for any given object x whether or not x belongs to the set."
259,"The objects that
belong to a set are called its elements or members."
260,"We will denote sets by capital letters,
such as A or X; if a is an element of the set A, we write a A.
A set is usually specified either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or
by st"
261,"We
might write
X = {x1, x2, . . ."
262,", xn}
for a set containing elements x1, x2, . . ."
263,", xn or
X = {x : x satisfies P}
if each x in X satisfies a certain property P."
264,"For example, if E is the set of even positive
integers, we can describe E by writing either
E = {2, 4, 6, . . ."
265,"}
or
E = {x : x is an even integer and x > 0}.

269,We can find various relations between sets as well as perform operations on sets.
270,"A set
A is a subset of B, written A B or B A, if every element of A is also an element of B.
For example,
{4, 5, 8} {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

N Z Q R C.
Trivially, every set is a subset of itself."
271,"A set B is a proper subset of a set A if B A but
B = A."
272,"If A is not a subset of B, we write A B; for example, {4, 7, 9} {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}.

273,"Two sets are equal, written A = B, if we can show that A B and B A.
It is convenient to have a set with no elements in it."
274,"This set is called the empty set
and is denoted by . Note that the empty set is a subset of every set.
"
275,"To construct new sets out of old sets, we can perform certain operations: the union
A B of two sets A and B is defined as
A B = {x : x A or x B};
the intersection of A and B is defined by
A B = {x : x"
276,"If A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3, 9}, then

310,"Otherwise, we must show that (A B) A B and (A B) A B. Let
x (A B)."

To show the reverse inclusion, suppose that x"
315,"Then x A and x B, and
so x /A and x /B."

Cartesian Products and Mappings
Given sets A and B, we can define a new set A  B, called the Cartesian product of A and
B, as a set of ordered pairs."
323,"That is,
A  B = {(a, b) : a A and b B}.
"
324,"Example 1.5 If A = {x, y}, B = {1, 2, 3}, and C = , then A  B is the set
{(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)}
and
A  C = .

We define the Cartesian product of n sets to be
A1     "
325,"An = {(a1, . . . , an) : ai Ai for i = 1, . . . , n}.
"
326,"If A = A1 = A2 =    = An, we often write An for A     "
327,"A (where A would be written
n times)."
328,"For example, the set R3 consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.
"
329,Subsets of A  B are called relations.
330,"We will define a mapping or function f A  B
from a set A to a set B to be the special type of relation where each element a A has
a unique element b B such that (a, b) f."
331,"Another way of saying this is that for every
element in A, f assigns a unique element in B."
332,"We usually write f : A B or A
fB.
Instead of writing down ordered pairs (a, b) A  B, we write f(a) = b or f : a 7b."
333,"The
set A is called the domain of f and
f(A) = {f(a) : a A} B
is called the range or image of f."

input values and the elements in the functions range as output values.

339,"A B, it is often possible to write a list describing what the
function does to each specific element in the domain."
340,"However, not all functions can be
described in this manner."
341,"For example, the function f : R R that sends each real number
to its cube is a mapping that must be described by writing f(x) = x3 or f :"
342,"x 7x3.
Consider the relation f : Q Z given by f(p/q) ="
343,"We know that 1/2 = 2/4, but
is f(1/2) = 1 or 2?"
344,This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not well-defined.
345,"A
relation is well-defined if each element in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the
range.
"
346,"If f : A B is a map and the image of f is B, i.e., f(A) = B, then f is said to
be onto or surjective."
347,"In other words, if there exists an a A for each b B such that
f(a) = b, then f is onto."
348,"A map is one-to-one or injective if a1 = a2 implies f(a1) = f(a2).
"
349,"Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if f(a1) = f(a2) implies a1"
350,"A map that is both
one-to-one and onto is called bijective.

terms with a positive denominator."

function as the domain of the second function."

Equivalence Relations and Partitions
A fundamental notion in mathematics is that of equality."
431,"We can generalize equality with
equivalence relations and equivalence classes.
"
432,"An equivalence relation on a set X is a
relation R X "
433,"X such that
 (x, x) R for all x X (reflexive property);
 (x, y) R implies (y, x) R (symmetric property);
 (x, y) and (y, z) R imply (x, z) R (transitive property).
"
434,"Given an equivalence relation R on a set X, we usually write x y instead of (x, y) R.
If the equivalence relation already has an associated notation such as =, , or =, we will
use that notation.
"
435,"Example 1.21 Let p, q, r, and s be integers, where q and s are nonzero."
436,"Define p/q r/s
if ps = qr."
437,Clearly is reflexive and symmetric.
438,"To show that it is also transitive, suppose
that p/q r/s and r/s t/u, with q, s, and u all nonzero."
439,"Then ps = qr and ru = st.
"
440,"Therefore,
psu = qru = qst.
"
441,"Since s = 0, pu = qt."
442,"Consequently, p/q t/u.

Example 1.22 Suppose that f and g are differentiable functions on R. We can define an
equivalence relation on such functions by letting f(x) g(x) if f(x) = g(x)."
443,"It is clear that
is both reflexive and symmetric."
444,"To demonstrate transitivity, suppose that f(x) g(x)
and g(x) h(x)."
445,From calculus we know that f(x)g(x) = c1 and g(x)h(x)
446,"= c2, where
c1 and c2 are both constants."
447,"Hence,
f(x) h(x)"
448,= (f(x) g(x))
449,+ (g(x) h(x))

and f(x) h(x)"

relation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes."
467,"Also, whenever a partition of a
set exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation, as the following theorem
demonstrates.
"
468,"Theorem 1.25 Given an equivalence relation on a set X, the equivalence classes of X
form a partition of X. Conversely, if P = {Xi} is a partition of a set X, then there is an
equivalence relation on X"
469,Suppose there exists an equivalence relation on the set X.

Let two elements be
equivalent if they are in the same partition."
481,"Clearly, the relation is reflexive."
482,"If x is in the
same partition as y, then y is in the same partition as x, so x y implies y x."

x is in the same partition as y and y is in the same partition as z, then x must be in the

495,"We claim that congruence modulo n forms an
equivalence relation of Z."
496,"Certainly any integer r is equivalent to itself since r r = 0 is
divisible by n."
497,We will now show that the relation is symmetric.
498,"If r s (mod n), then
r s = (s r) is divisible by n."
499,So s r is divisible by n and s r (mod n).
500,"Now
suppose that r s (mod n) and s t (mod n)."
501,"Then there exist integers k and l such
that r s = kn and s t = ln."
502,"To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that r t is
divisible by n."
503,"However,
r t = r s + s t = kn + ln = (k + l)n,
and so r t is divisible by n.

The Integers
"
633,The integers are the building blocks of mathematics.
634,"In this chapter we will investigate
the fundamental properties of the integers, including mathematical induction, the division
algorithm, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Suppose we wish to show that

for any natural number n."
636,"This formula is easily verified for small numbers such as n = 1,

prove the formula true in general, a more generic method is required.

that we can generate the formula for the (n + 1)th case from this knowledge."
640,"The formula
is true for n = 1 since
1 = 1(1 + 1)

.
"

verify a statement about some subset S of the positive integers N on a case-by-case basis, an
impossible task if S is an infinite set, we give a specific proof for the smalles"

induction in the following axiom.

than or equal to n0.
"
653,"Example 2.2 For all integers n 3, 2n > n + 4."
654,"Since
8 = 23 > 3 + 4 = 7,
the statement is true for n0 = 3."
655,Assume that 2k >
656,k + 4 for k 3.

689,"Principle 2.6
Principle of Well-Ordering.
"
690,"Every nonempty subset of the natural
numbers is well-ordered.
"
691,"The Principle of Well-Ordering is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
"
692,"Lemma 2.7 The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that 1 is the least positive
natural number.
Proof."
693,Let S = {n N : n 1}.
694,"Then 1 S. Assume that n S. Since 0 < 1, it must
be the case that n = n + 0 < n + 1."
695,"Therefore, 1 n < n + 1."

697,"That is, every nonempty subset of N contains a least element.
Proof.
"
698,"We must show that if S is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers, then S
contains a least element."
699,"If S contains 1, then the theorem is true by Lemma 2.7."
700,"Assume
that if S contains an integer k such that 1 k n, then S contains a least element."
701,"We
will show that if a set S contains an integer less than or equal to n + 1, then S has a least
element."
702,"If S does not contain an integer less than n + 1, then n + 1 is the smallest integer
in S. Otherwise, since S is nonempty, S must contain an integer less than or equal to n. In
this case, by induction"

Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions."

ways to define n!, the factorial of a positive integer n.

2.2 The Division Algorithm
"
708,"An application of the Principle of Well-Ordering that we will use often is the division
algorithm.
"
709,"Theorem 2.9
Division Algorithm."
710,"Let a and b be integers, with b > 0."
711,"Then there
exist unique integers q and r such that
a = bq + r
where 0"
712,"r < b.
Proof."
713,This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.
714,"We must
first prove that the numbers q and r actually exist."
715,"Then we must show that if q and r
are two other such numbers, then q = q and r = r.
Existence of q and r. Let
S = {a bk : k Z and a bk 0}.
"
716,"If 0 S, then b divides a, and we can let q = a/b and r = 0."
717,"If 0 /S, we can use the
Well-Ordering Principle."
718,We must first show that S is nonempty.
719,"If a > 0, then ab0 S.
If a < 0, then a b(2a) = a(1 2b)"
720,"In either case S = . By the Well-Ordering
Principle, S must have a smallest member, say r = a bq."
721,"Therefore, a = bq + r, r 0.
"
722,We now show that r < b. Suppose
723,that r > b.
724,"Then
a b(q"
725,"+ 1) = a bq b = r b > 0.
"
726,In this case we would have a b(q
727,+ 1) in the set S.
728,But then a b(q
729,"+ 1) < a bq, which
would contradict the fact that r = a bq is the smallest member of S. So r b."
730,"Since
0 /S, r = b and so r < b.
Uniqueness of q and r. Suppose there exist integers r, r, q, and q such that
a = bq + r, 0 r < b
and
a = bq + r, 0"
731,"r < b.
"
732,Then bq+r = bq+r. Assume that r r.
733,"From the last equation we have b(qq) = rr;
therefore, b must divide r r and 0"
734,r r r <
735,"This is possible only if r r = 0.
"
736,"Hence, r = r and q = q.

Let a and b be integers."
737,"If b = ak for some integer k, we write a | b."
738,"An integer d
is called a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b."
739,"The greatest common divisor of
integers a and b is a positive integer d such that d is a common divisor of a and b and if d
is any other common divisor of a and b, then d | d.
"
740,"We write d = gcd(a, b); for example,
gcd(24, 36) = 12 and gcd(120, 102) = 6."
741,"We say that two integers a and b are relatively
prime if gcd(a, b) = 1.
"
742,Theorem 2.10 Let a and b be nonzero integers.
743,"Then there exist integers r and s such that
gcd(a, b) = ar + bs.
"
744,"Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of a and b is unique.
Proof."
745,"Let
S = {am + bn : m, n Z and am + bn > 0}.
"
746,"Clearly, the set S is nonempty; hence, by the Well-Ordering Principle S must have a smallest
member, say d = ar + bs."
747,"We claim that d = gcd(a, b)."
748,"Write a = dq + r where 0 r < d.

"
750,"If r > 0, then
r = a dq
= a (ar + bs)q
= a arq bsq
= a(1 rq)"
751,"+ b(sq),
which is in S."
752,"But this would contradict the fact that d is the smallest member of S. Hence,
r = 0 and d divides a."
753,A similar argument shows that d divides b.
754,"Therefore, d is a common
divisor of a and b.
Suppose that d is another common divisor of a and b, and we want to show that d | d.
"
755,"If we let a = dh and b = dk, then
d = ar + bs = dhr"
756,"+ dks = d(hr + ks).
"
757,So d must divide d.
758,"Hence, d must be the unique greatest common divisor of a and b.

Corollary 2.11 Let a and b be two integers that are relatively prime."
759,"Then there exist
integers r and s such that ar + bs"
760,"The Euclidean Algorithm
Among other things, Theorem 2.10 allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of
two integers.
"
761,Example 2.12 Let us compute the greatest common divisor of 945 and 2415.
762,"First observe
that
2415 = 945  2 + 525
945 = 525  1 + 420
525 = 420  1 + 105
420 = 105  4 + 0.
"
763,"Reversing our steps, 105 divides 420, 105 divides 525, 105 divides 945, and 105 divides 2415.
"
764,"Hence, 105 divides both 945 and 2415."
765,"If d were another common divisor of 945 and 2415,
then d would also have to divide 105."
766,"Therefore, gcd(945, 2415) = 105.

Let p be an integer such that p > 1."

either p | a or p | b.
Proof."
785,Suppose that p does not divide a.
786,We must show that p | b.
787,"Since gcd(a, p) = 1,
there exist integers r and s such that ar + ps = 1."

Proof.
Uniqueness."
803,To show uniqueness we will use induction on n.
804,"The theorem is
certainly true for n = 2 since in this case n is prime."
805,"Now assume that the result holds for
all integers m such that 1 m < n, and
n = p1p2    pk = q1q2    ql,
where p1 p2    pk and q1 q2    ql."
806,"By Lemma 2.13, p1 | qi for some
i = 1, . . ."
807,", l and q1 | pj for some j = 1, . ."
808,"Since all of the pis and qis are prime, p1 = qi
and q1 = pj."
809,"Hence, p1 = q1 since p1 pj = q1 qi = p1."
810,"By the induction hypothesis,
n = p2    pk = q2    ql
has a unique factorization."
811,"Hence, k = l and qi = pi for i = 1, . . ."
812,", k.
Existence."
813,"To show existence, suppose that there is some integer that cannot be written
as the product of primes."
814,Let S be the set of all such numbers.
815,"By the Principle of Well-
Ordering, S has a smallest number, say a."
816,"If the only positive factors of a are a and 1, then
a is prime, which is a contradiction."
817,"Hence, a = a1a2 where 1 < a1 < a and 1 < a2 < a.
"
818,"Neither a1 S nor a2 S, since a is the smallest element in S. So
a1 = p1    pr
a2 = q1    qs.
"
819,"Therefore,
a = a1a2 = p1    prq1    qs.
"
820,"So a /S, which is a contradiction.

Historical Note
Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks."

uity are Euclids proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positiv"
823,"One
problem in number theory is to find a function f such that f(n) is prime for each integer n.
Pierre Fermat (1601?1665) conjectured that 22n"
824,"+ 1 was prime for all n, but later it was
shown by Leonhard Euler (17071783) that
225 + 1 = 4,294,967,297
is a composite number."
825,"One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is
Goldbachs Conjecture."
826,"In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjec-
ture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes:
4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, . . .."
827,"Although the conjecture has been verified for the
numbers up through 4  1018, it has yet to be proven in general."
828,"Since prime numbers play
an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in
determining whether or not a large number is prime.

"
991,"The integers mod n and the symmetries of a triangle or a rectangle are examples of groups.
"
992,A binary operation or law of composition on a set G is a function G 
993,"G G that assigns
to each pair (a, b) G"
994," G a unique element a b, or ab in G, called the composition of
a and b."
995,"A group (G, ) is a set G together with a law of composition (a, b) 7a"
996,"b that
satisfies the following axioms.

"
997,"CHAPTER 3. GROUPS

"
998,The law of composition is associative.
999,"That is,
(a b) c"
1000,"= a (b c)
for a, b, c G.
 There exists an element e G, called the identity element, such that for any element
a G
e a = a e = a.
"
1001,"For each element a G, there exists an inverse element in G, denoted by a1, such
that
a a1 = a1 a = e.
A group G with the property that a b = b a for all a, b G is called abelian or com-
mutative."
1002,"Groups not satisfying this property are said to be nonabelian or noncommutative.
"
1003,Example 3.8 The integers Z = {. . .
1004,", 1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} form a group under the operation of
addition."
1005,"The binary operation on two integers m, n Z is just their sum."
1006,"Since the integers
under addition already have a well-established notation, we will use the operator + instead
of ; that is, we shall write m"
1007,+ n instead of m n.
1008,"The identity is 0, and the inverse of
n Z is written as n instead of n1."
1009,"Notice that the set of integers under addition have
the additional property that m + n = n + m and therefore form an abelian group.
"
1010,"
Most of the time we will write ab instead of a b; however, if the group already has a
natural operation such as addition in the integers, we will use that operation."
1011,"That is, if
we are adding two integers, we still write m"
1012,"+ n, n for the inverse, and 0 for the identity
as usual."
1013,We also write m n instead of m +
1014,"It is often convenient to describe a group in terms of an addition or multiplication table.
"
1015,"Such a table is called a Cayley table.
"
1016,"Example 3.9 The integers mod n form a group under addition modulo n. Consider Z5,
consisting of the equivalence classes of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4."
1017,"We define the group
operation on Z5 by modular addition."
1018,"We write the binary operation on the group additively;
that is, we write m +"

has an inverse."

the group is said to be infinite or to have infinite order."

Basic Properties of Groups
Proposition 3.17"
1062,"The identity element in a group G is unique; that is, there exists only
one element e G such that eg = ge = g for all g G.
Proof."
1063,Suppose that e and e are both identities in G. Then eg = ge = g and eg = ge
1064,"= g
for all g G. We need to show that e = e."
1065,"If we think of e as the identity, then ee = e;
but if e is the identity, then ee = e. Combining these two equations, we have e = ee = e.

Inverses in a group are also unique.
"
1066,"If g and g are both inverses of an element g
in a group G, then gg = gg = e and gg = gg = e. We want to show that g = g,
but g = ge = g(gg)"
1067,"= (gg)g = eg = g. We summarize this fact in the following
proposition.
"
1068,"Proposition 3.18 If g is any element in a group G, then the inverse of g, denoted by g1,
is unique.
"
1069,Proposition 3.19 Let G be a group.
1070,"If a, b G, then (ab)1 = b1a1.
Proof."
1071,"Let a, b G. Then abb1a1 = aea1 = aa1 = e. Similarly, b1a1ab = e."
1072,"But
by the previous proposition, inverses are unique; hence, (ab)1 = b1a1.
"
1073,"
Proposition 3.20 Let G be a group."
1074,"For any a G, (a1)1 = a.
Proof."
1075,"Observe that a1(a1)1 = e. Consequently, multiplying both sides of this equa-
tion by a, we have
(a1)1 = e(a1)1 = aa1(a1)1 = ae = a.

It makes sense to write equations with group elements and group ope"
1076,"If a and b
are two elements in a group G, does there exist an element x G such that ax = b?"
1077,"If such
an x does exist, is it unique?"
1078,"The following proposition answers both of these questions
positively.
"
1079,Proposition 3.21 Let G be a group and a and b be any two elements in G.
1080,"Then the
equations ax = b and xa = b have unique solutions in G.

CHAPTER 3. GROUPS
37
Proof."
1081,Suppose that ax = b.
1082,We must show that such an x exists.
1083,"We can multiply both
sides of ax = b by a1 to find x = ex = a1ax = a1b.
To show uniqueness, suppose that x1 and x2 are both solutions of ax = b; then ax1 =
b = ax2."
1084,So x1 = a1ax1 = a1ax2
1085,"The proof for the existence and uniqueness of
the solution of xa = b is similar.
"
1086,"
Proposition 3.22 If G is a group and a, b, c G, then ba = ca implies b = c and ab = ac
implies b = c.
"
1087,This proposition tells us that the right and left cancellation laws are true in groups.
1088,"We
leave the proof as an exercise.
"
1089,We can use exponential notation for groups just as we do in ordinary algebra.
1090,"If G is a
group and g G, then we define g0 = e. For n N, we define
gn = g  g    g
|
{z
}
n times
and
gn = g1  g1    g1
|
{z
}
n times
.
"
1091,"Theorem 3.23 In a group, the usual laws of exponents hold; that is, for all g, h G,
1."
1092,"gmgn = gm+n for all m, n Z;
2."
1093,"(gm)n = gmn for all m, n Z;
3."
1094,(gh)n = (h1g1)n for all n Z.
1095,"Furthermore, if G is abelian, then (gh)n = gnhn.
We will leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise."
1096,"Notice that (gh)n = gnhn in
general, since the group may not be abelian."
1097,"If the group is Z or Zn, we write the group
operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively; that is, we write ng
instead of gn."
1098,"The laws of exponents now become
1."
1099,"ng = (m + n)g for all m, n Z;
2. m(ng)"
1100,"= (mn)g for all m, n Z;
3. m(g"
1101,"= mg + mh for all n Z.
It is important to realize that the last statement can be made only because Z and Zn
are commutative groups.
"
1102,"Historical Note
Although the first clear axiomatic definition of a group was not given until the late 1800s,
group-theoretic methods had been employed before this time in the development of many
areas"
1103,"Joseph-Louis Lagrange used group-theoretic methods in a 17701771 memoir to study meth-
ods of solving polynomial equations."
1104,"Later, variste Galois (18111832) succeeded in devel-
oping the mathematics necessary to determine exactly which polynomial equations could be
solved in terms of the coeicients of the polynomial."
1105,"Galois primary tool was group theory.
"
1106,"The study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein proposed that geo-
metric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under
a transformation of the spac"
1107,"Sophus Lie, a contemporary of Klein, used group theory
to study solutions of partial differential equations."

group theory appeared in William Burnsides The Theory of Groups of Finite Order [1],
first published in 1897.

Definitions and Examples
Sometimes we wish to investigate smaller groups sitting inside a larger group."
1110,"The set of
even integers 2Z = {. . . , 2, 0, 2, 4, . . .} is a group under the operation of addition."
1111,"This
smaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition."
1112,"We define a
subgroup H of a group G to be a subset H of G such that when the group operation of
G is restricted to H, H is a group in its own right."
1113,"Observe that every group G with at
least two elements will always have at least two subgroups, the subgroup consisting of the
identity element alone and the entire group itself."
1114,"The subgroup H = {e} of a group G
is called the trivial subgroup."
1115,"A subgroup that is a proper subset of G is called a proper
subgroup."
1116,"In many of the examples that we have investigated up to this point, there exist
other subgroups besides the trivial and improper subgroups.
"
1117,"Example 3.24 Consider the set of nonzero real numbers, R, with the group operation of
multiplication."
1118,"The identity of this group is 1 and the inverse of any element a Ris just
1/a. We will show that

(p/q)1 = q/p. Since multiplication in Ris associative, multiplication in Qis associative.

Some Subgroup Theorems
Let us examine some criteria for determining exactly when a subset of a group is a subgroup.
"
1146,"A subset H of G is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following
conditions.
"
1147,"The identity e of G is in H.
2."
1148,"If h1, h2 H, then h1h2 H.
3."
1149,"If h H, then h1 H.
Proof."
1150,"First suppose that H is a subgroup of G. We must show that the three conditions
hold."
1151,"Since H is a group, it must have an identity eH. We must show that eH = e, where e is
the identity of G."
1152,"We know that eHeH = eH and that eeH = eHe = eH; hence, eeH = eHeH.
By right-hand cancellation, e = eH."
1153,"The second condition holds since a subgroup H is a
group."
1154,"To prove the third condition, let h H. Since H is a group, there is an element
h H such that hh = hh = e."
1155,"By the uniqueness of the inverse in G, h = h1.
"
1156,"Conversely, if the three conditions hold, we must show that H is a group under the same
operation as G; however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are
exactly the axioms "
1157,"
Proposition 3.31 Let H be a subset of a group"
1158,"G. Then H is a subgroup of G if and only
if H = , and whenever g, h H then gh1 is in H.
Proof."
1159,"First assume that H is a subgroup of G. We wish to show that gh1 H whenever
g and h are in H. Since h is in H, its inverse h1 must also be in H. Because of the closure
of the group operation, gh1 H.

1160,"H. If
g H, then gg1 = e is in H. If g H, then eg1 = g1 is also in H. Now let h1, h2 H.

Cyclic Groups
The groups Z and Zn, which are among the most familiar and easily understood groups, are
both examples of what are called cyclic groups."
1326,"In this chapter we will study the properties
of cyclic groups and cyclic subgroups, which play a fundamental part in the classification
of all abelian groups.
"
1327,"4.1 Cyclic Subgroups
Often a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group; that is, knowing
that particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup.
"
1328,"Example 4.1 Suppose that we consider 3 Z and look at all multiples (both positive and
negative) of 3."
1329,"As a set, this is

1330,", 3, 0, 3, 6, . . .}.
"
1331,It is easy to see that 3Z is a subgroup of the integers.
1332,"This subgroup is completely deter-
mined by the element 3 since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking
multiples of 3."
1333,"Every element in the subgroup is generated by 3.

closure; hence, H contains a. Therefor"

that an = e, and we write |a| = n."

Subgroups of Cyclic Groups
"
1364,"We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of
a cyclic group."
1365,"If G is a group, which subgroups of G are cyclic?"
1366,"If G is a cyclic group,
what type of subgroups does G possess?
"
1367,"Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
"
1368,"The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of
Well-Ordering."
1369,"Let G be a cyclic group generated by a and suppose that H is a subgroup
of G. If H = {e}, then trivially H is cyclic."
1370,"Suppose that H contains some other element
g distinct from the identity."
1371,Then g can be written as an for some integer n.
1372,"Since H is a
subgroup, g1 = an must also be in H. Since either n or n is positive, we can assume
that H contains positive powers of a and n > 0."
1373,"Let m be the smallest natural number
such that am H."
1374,"Such an m exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.
"
1375,"We claim that h = am is a generator for H. We must show that every h H can be
written as a power of h. Since h H and H is a subgroup of G, h = ak for some integer
k. Using the division algorithm, we c"
1376,So ar = akhq.
1377,"Since ak and hq are in H, ar must also be in H. However, m was the
smallest positive number such that am was in H; consequently, r = 0 and so k = mq.
"
1378,"Therefore,
h = ak = amq = hq
and H is generated by h.

Corollary 4.11 The subgroups of Z are exactly nZ for n = 0, 1, 2, . ."
1379,"Proposition 4.12 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a is a generator for
G. Then ak = e if and only if n divides k.
Proof."
1380,"First suppose that ak = e. By the division algorithm, k = nq + r where 0 r < n;
hence,
e = ak = anq+r = anqar = ear = ar.
"
1381,"Since the smallest positive integer m such that am = e is n, r = 0.
"
1382,"Conversely, if n divides k, then k = ns for some integer s."
1383,"Consequently,
ak = ans = (an)s = es = e.

Theorem 4.13 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a G is a generator
of the group."
1384,"If b = ak, then the order of b is n/d, where d = gcd(k, n).
"
1385,We wish to find the smallest integer m such that e = bm = akm.
1386,"By Proposi-
tion 4.12, this is the smallest integer m such that n divides km or, equivalently, n/d divides
m(k/d)."
1387,"Since d is the greatest common divisor of n and k, n/d and k/d are relatively
prime."
1388,"Hence, for n/d to divide m(k/d) it must divide m."
1389,"The smallest such m is n/d.

Corollary 4.14 The generators of Zn are the integers r such that 1 r < n and gcd(r, n) =
1.

moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had

1475,"It could be thousands or even millions of

1477,"However, if we could compute something like
237,398,332
(mod 46,389),
we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388.
"
1478,"If we want to compute powers modulo n quickly and eiciently, we will have to be clever.4
The first thing to notice is that any number a can be written as the sum of distinct
powers of 2; that is, we c"

where k1 < k2 <    < kn."
1480,"This is just the binary representation of a. For example, the
binary representation of 57 is 111001, since we can write 57 = 20 + 23 + 24 + 25.
"
1481,"The laws of exponents still work in Zn; that is, if b ax (mod n) and c ay (mod n),
then bc ax+y (mod n)."
1482,"We can compute a2k (mod n) in k multiplications by computing
a20
(mod n)
a21
(mod n)
...
a2k
(mod n).
"
1483,"Each step involves squaring the answer obtained in the previous step, dividing by n, and
taking the remainder.
"
1484,Example 4.28 We will compute 271321 (mod 481).
1485,"Notice that
321 = 20 + 26 + 28;
hence, computing 271321 (mod 481) is the same as computing
27120+26+28 27120  27126  27128
(mod 481).
"
1486,"So it will suice to compute 2712i (mod 481) where i = 0, 6, 8."
1487,"It is very easy to see that
27121 = 73,441 329
(mod 481).
"
1488,"We can square this result to obtain a value for 27122 (mod 481):

(329)2
(mod 481)
108,241
(mod 481)

"
1489,We are using the fact that (a2n)2 a22n a2n+1 (mod n).

Remark 5.11 From this point forward we will find it convenient to use cycle notation to rep-
resent permutations."
1696,"When using cycle notation, we often denote the identity permutation
by (1).
"
1697,"Transpositions
The simplest permutation is a cycle of length 2."
1698,Such cycles are called transpositions.
1699,"Since
(a1, a2, . . ."
1700,", an) = (a1, an)(a1, an1)    (a1, a3)(a1, a2),
any cycle can be written as the product of transpositions, leading to the following proposi-
tion.
"
1701,"Proposition 5.12 Any permutation of a finite set containing at least two elements can be
written as the product of transpositions.
"
1702,"Example 5.13 Consider the permutation
(1 6)(2 5 3) = (1 6)(2 3)(2 5) = (1 6)(4 5)(2 3)(4 5)(2 5).
"
1703,"As we can see, there is no unique way to represent permutation as the product of transposi-
tions."
1704,"For instance, we can write the identity permutation as (1 2)(1 2), as (1 3)(2 4)(1 3)(2 4),
and in many other ways."
1705,"However, as it turns out, no permutation can be written as the
product of both an even number of transpositions and an odd number of transpositions.
"
1706,"For instance, we could represent the permutation (1 6) by
(2 3)(1 6)(2 3)
or by
(3 5)(1 6)(1 3)(1 6)(1 3)(3 5)(5 6),
but (1 6) will always be the product of an odd number of transpositions.
"
1707,"
Lemma 5.14 If the identity is written as the product of r transpositions,
id = 12    r,
then r is an even number.
"
1708,"We will employ induction on r. A transposition cannot be the identity; hence,
r > 1."
1709,"If r = 2, then we are done."
1710,Suppose that r > 2.
1711,"In this case the product of the last
two transpositions, r1r, must be one of the following cases:
(a, b)(a, b) = id
(b, c)(a, b) = (a, c)(b, c)
(c, d)(a, b) = (a, b)(c, d)
(a, c)(a, b) = (a, b)(b, c),"
1712,"PERMUTATION GROUPS
64
"
1713,The first equation simply says that a transposition is its own inverse.
1714,"If this case occurs,
delete r1r from the product to obtain
id = 12    r3r2.
"
1715,"By induction r 2 is even; hence, r must be even.
"
1716,"In each of the other three cases, we can replace r1r with the right-hand side of the
corresponding equation to obtain a new product of r transpositions for the identity."
1717,"In this
new product the last occurrence of a will be in the next-to-the-last transposition."
1718,"We can
continue this process with r2r1 to obtain either a product of r 2 transpositions or a
new product of r transpositions where the last occurrence of a is in r2."
1719,"If the identity is
the product of r 2 transpositions, then again we are done, by our induction hypothesis;
otherwise, we will repeat the procedure with r3r2.
"
1720,"At some point either we will have two adjacent, identical transpositions canceling each
other out or a will be shuffled so that it will appear only in the first transposition."
1721,"However,
the latter case cannot occur, because the identity would not fix a in this instance."
1722,"Therefore,
the identity permutation must be the product of r 2 transpositions and, again by our
induction hypothesis, we are done.
"
1723,"
Theorem 5.15 If a permutation  can be expressed as the product of an even number of
transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling  must also contain an even
number of transpositio"
1724,"Similarly, if  can be expressed as the product of an odd number
of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling  must also contain an
odd number of transpositions.
Proof."
1725,"Suppose that
 = 12  "
1726," m = 12    n,
where m is even."
1727,We must show that n is also an even number.
1728,"The inverse of  is m    1.
"
1729,"Since
id = m    1 = 1    nm    1,
n must be even by Lemma 5.14."
1730,"The proof for the case in which  can be expressed as an
odd number of transpositions is left as an exercise.
"
1731,"
In light of Theorem 5.15, we define a permutation to be even if it can be expressed
as an even number of transpositions and odd if it can be expressed as an odd number of
transpositions.
"
1732,"The Alternating Groups
One of the most important subgroups of Sn is the set of all even permutations, An."
1733,"The
group An is called the alternating group on n letters.
"
1734,"The set An is a subgroup of Sn.
Proof."
1735,"Since the product of two even permutations must also be an even permutation,
An is closed."
1736,The identity is an even permutation and therefore is in An.
1737,"If  is an even
permutation, then
 = 12    r,
where i is a transposition and r is even."

Historical Note
Lagrange first thought of permutations as functions from a set to itself, but it was Cauchy
who developed the basic theorems and notation for permutations.
"
1756,"He was the first to
use cycle notation."
1757,"Augustin-Louis Cauchy (17891857) was born in Paris at the height
of the French Revolution."
1758,"His family soon left Paris for the village of Arcueil to escape
the Reign of Terror."
1759,"One of the familys neighbors there was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749
1827), who encouraged him to seek a career in mathematics."
1760,"Cauchy began his career as
a mathematician by solving a problem in geometry given to him by Lagrange.
"
1761,"Cauchy
wrote over 800 papers on such diverse topics as differential equations, finite groups, applied
mathematics, and complex analysis.
"
1762,"He was one of the mathematicians responsible for
making calculus rigorous."
1763,"Perhaps more theorems and concepts in mathematics have the
name Cauchy attached to them than that of any other mathematician.
"
1764,"5.2 Dihedral Groups
Another special type of permutation group is the dihedral group."
1765,"Recall the symmetry
group of an equilateral triangle in Chapter 3."
1766,"Such groups consist of the rigid motions of a
regular n-sided polygon or n-gon."
1767,"For n = 3, 4, . ."
1768,"., we define the nth dihedral group to be
the group of rigid motions of a regular n-gon."
1769,We will denote this group by Dn.
1770,"We can
number the vertices of a regular n-gon by 1, 2, . ."
1771,". , n (Figure 5.19)."
1772,"Notice that there are
exactly n choices to replace the first vertex."
1773,"If we replace the first vertex by k, then the
second vertex must be replaced either by vertex k+1 or by vertex k1; hence, there are 2n
possible rigid motions of the n-gon."
1774,"We summarize these results in the following theorem.

The Motion Group of a Cube
We can investigate the groups of rigid motions of geometric objects other than a regular
n-sided polygon to obtain interesting examples of permutation groups."
1809,"Let us consider the
group of rigid motions of a cube."
1810,"By rigid motion, we mean a rotation with the axis of
rotation about opposing faces, edges, or vertices."
1811,"One of the first questions that we can ask
about this group is what is its order?"
1812,A cube has 6 sides.
1813,"If a particular side is facing
upward, then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-
facing side."
1814,"Hence, the order of the group is 6  4 = 24."
1815,"We have just proved the following
proposition.
"
1816,"Proposition 5.26 The group of rigid motions of a cube contains 24 elements.
"
1817,"Theorem 5.27 The group of rigid motions of a cube is S4.
"
1818,"From Proposition 5.26, we already know that the motion group of the cube has 24
elements, the same number of elements as there are in S4."
1819,"There are exactly four diagonals
in the cube."
1820,"If we label these diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, we must show that the motion group
of the cube will give us any permutation of the diagonals (Figure 5.28)."
1821,"If we can obtain
all of these permutations, then S4 and the group of rigid motions of the cube must be the
same."
1822,"To obtain a transposition we can rotate the cube 180about the axis joining the
midpoints of opposite edges (Figure 5.29)."
1823,"There are six such axes, giving all transpositions
in S4."
1824,"Since every element in S4 is the product of a finite number of transpositions, the
motion group of a cube must be S4.

Cosets and Lagranges Theorem
Lagranges Theorem, one of the most important results in finite group theory, states that the
order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group."
1913,"This theorem provides a powerful
tool for analyzing finite groups; it gives us an idea of exactly what type of subgroups we
might expect a finite group to possess."
1914,"Central to understanding Lagrangess Theorem is
the notion of a coset.
"
1915,"6.1 Cosets
Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. Define a left coset of H with representative
g G to be the set
gH"
1916,"= {gh : h H}.
"
1917,"Right cosets can be defined similarly by
Hg = {hg : h H}.
"
1918,"If left and right cosets coincide or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that
we are referring, we will use the word coset without specifying left or right.
"
1919,Example 6.1 Let H be the subgroup of Z6 consisting of the elements 0 and 3.
1920,"The cosets
are
0"
1921,"+ H = 3 + H = {0, 3}
1"
1922,"+ H = 4 + H = {1, 4}
2 +"
1923,"H = 5 + H = {2, 5}.
"
1924,"We will always write the cosets of subgroups of Z and Zn with the additive notation we have
used for cosets here."
1925,"In a commutative group, left and right cosets are always identical.
"
1926,"
Example 6.2 Let H be the subgroup of S3 defined by the permutations {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}.
"
1927,"The left cosets of H are
(1)H = (1 2 3)H = (1 3 2)H = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}
(1 2)H = (1 3)H = (2 3)H = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)}.
"
1928,"The right cosets of H are exactly the same as the left cosets:
H(1) = H(1 2 3) = H(1 3 2) = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}
H(1 2) = H(1 3) = H(2 3) = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)}.
"
1929,"74

CHAPTER 6. COSETS AND LAGRANGES THEOREM
75
"
1930,It is not always the case that a left coset is the same as a right coset.
1931,"Let K be the
subgroup of S3 defined by the permutations {(1), (1 2)}."
1932,"Then the left cosets of K are
(1)K = (1 2)K = {(1), (1 2)}
(1 3)K = (1 2 3)K = {(1 3), (1 2 3)}
(2 3)K = (1 3 2)K = {(2 3), (1 3 2)};
however, the right cosets of K are
K(1) = K(1 2) = {(1), (1 2)}

1933,"
The following lemma is quite useful when dealing with cosets."
1934,"(We leave its proof as an
exercise.)
"
1935,"Lemma 6.3 Let H be a subgroup of a group G and suppose that g1, g2 G."

In all of our examples the cosets of a subgroup H partition"
1940,"the larger group G. The
following theorem proclaims that this will always be the case.
"
1941,Theorem 6.4 Let H be a subgroup of a group
1942,"G. Then the left cosets of H in G partition
G."
1943,"That is, the group G is the disjoint union of the left cosets of H in G.
Proof."
1944,"Let g1H and g2H be two cosets of H in G. We must show that either g1Hg2H = 
or g1H = g2H. Suppose that g1H g2H = and a g1H g2H. Then by the definition
of a left coset, a = g1h1 = g2h2 for some element"
1945,"Right cosets also
partition G; the proof of this fact is exactly the same as the proof for left cosets except that
all group multiplications are done on the opposite side of H.
Let G be a group and H "
1946,"Example 6.6 Let G = Z6 and H = {0, 3}."
1947,"Then [G : H] = 3.

Example 6.7 Suppose that G = S3, H = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, and K = {(1), (1 2)}."
1948,"Then
[G : H] = 2 and"
1949,"[G : K] = 3.

Theorem 6.8 Let H be a subgroup of a group G."
1950,"The number of left cosets of H in G is
the same as the number of right cosets of H in G.
Proof."
1951,"Let LH and RH denote the set of left and right cosets of H in G, respectively.

1969,"Let G be a finite group and let H be a subgroup of G. Then

1970,"[G : H] is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G. In particular, the number

Proof."
1971,The group G is partitioned into [G : H] distinct left cosets.
1972,"Each left coset has
|H| elements; therefore, |G| ="

1974,"
Corollary 6.11 Suppose that G is a finite group and g G. Then the order of g must
divide the number of elements in G.
Corollary 6.12 Let |G| = p with p a prime number."
1975,"Then G is cyclic and any g G such
that g = e is a generator.
"
1976,Let g be in G such that g = e.
1977,"Then by Corollary 6.11, the order of g must divide
the order of the group."
1978,"Since |g| > 1, it must be p."
1979,"Hence, g generates G.

Corollary 6.12 suggests that groups of prime order p must somehow look like Zp.

Remark 6.14"
1986,The converse of Lagranges Theorem is false.
1987,"The group A4 has order
12; however, it can be shown that it does not possess a subgroup of order 6."
1988,"According to
Lagranges Theorem, subgroups of a group of order 12 can have orders of either 1, 2, 3, 4, or
6."
1989,"However, we are not guaranteed that subgroups of every possible order exist."
1990,"To prove
that A4 has no subgroup of order 6, we will assume that it does have such a subgroup H
and show that a contradiction must occur."
1991,"Since A4 contains eight 3-cycles, we know that
H must contain a 3-cycle."
1992,"We will show that if H contains one 3-cycle, then it must contain
more than 6 elements.
"
1993,"The group A4 has no subgroup of order 6.
Proof."
1994,"Since [A4 : H] = 2, there are only two cosets of H in A4."
1995,"Inasmuch as one of the
cosets is H itself, right and left cosets must coincide; therefore, gH"
1996,"= Hg or gHg1 = H
for every g A4."
1997,"Since there are eight 3-cycles in A4, at least one 3-cycle must be in H.
Without loss of generality, assume that (1 2 3) is in H. Then (1 2 3)1 = (1 3 2) must also

CHAPTER 6."
1998,"COSETS AND LAGRANGES THEOREM
77
be in H. Since ghg1 H for all g A4"
1999,"and all h H and
(1 2 4)(1 2 3)(1 2 4)1 = (1 2 4)(1 2 3)(1 4 2) = (2 4 3)
(2 4 3)(1 2 3)(2 4 3)1 = (2 4 3)(1 2 3)(2 3 4) = (1 4 2)
we can conclude that H must have at least seven elements
(1), (1 2 3),"
2000,"Therefore, A4 has no subgroup of order 6.

In fact, we can say more about when two cycles have the same length.

Lagranges abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19, communicated to Euler some work

assurance that the message is authentic; that is, that it has not been sent by someone who
is trying to deceive the recipie"
2098,"Modern cryptography is heavily dependent on abstract
algebra and number theory.
"
2099,The message to be sent is called the plaintext message.
2100,"The disguised message is called
the ciphertext."
2101,"The plaintext and the ciphertext are both written in an alphabet, consisting
of letters or characters."
2102,"Characters can include not only the familiar alphabetic characters
A, . ."
2103,"., Z and a, . ."
2104,"z but also digits, punctuation marks, and blanks."
2105,"A cryptosystem,
or cipher, has two parts: encryption, the process of transforming a plaintext message to
a ciphertext message, and decryption, the reverse transformation of changing a ciphertext
messa"
2106,"There are many different families of cryptosystems, each distinguished by a particular
encryption algorithm."
2107,"Cryptosystems in a specified cryptographic family are distinguished
from one another by a parameter to the encryption function called a key.
"
2108,"A classical
cryptosystem has a single key, which must be kept secret, known only to the sender and
the receiver of the message."
2109,"If person A wishes to send secret messages to two different
people B and C, and does not wish to have B understand Cs messages or vice versa, A
must use two separate keys, so one cryptosystem is used "
2110,"Since knowledge of the encoding key does not allow
anyone to guess at the decoding key, the encoding key can be made public."
2111,"A public key
cryptosystem allows A and B to send messages to C using the same encoding key."
2112,"Anyone
is capable of encoding a message to be sent to C, but only C knows how to decode such a
message.
"
2113,"7.1 Private Key Cryptography
In single or private key cryptosystems the same key is used for both encrypting and de-
crypting messages."
2114,"To encrypt a plaintext message, we apply to the message some function
which is kept secret, say f."
2115,This function will yield an encrypted message.
2116,"Given the en-
crypted form of the message, we can recover the original message by applying the inverse
transformation f1."
2117,"The transformation f must be relatively easy to compute, as must f1;
however, f must be extremely diicult to guess from available examples of coded messages.

CHAPTER 7. INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
82
Example 7.1 One of the first and most famous private key cryptosystems was the shift code
used by Julius Caesar."
2119,"We first digitize the alphabet by letting A = 00, B = 01, . . ."
2120,", Z = 25.
"
2121,"The encoding function will be
f(p)"
2122,"= p + 3 mod 26;
that is, A 7D, B 7E, . . ."
2123,", Z 7C."
2124,"The decoding function is then
f1(p) = p 3"
2125,"mod 26 = p + 23 mod 26.
"
2126,Suppose we receive the encoded message DOJHEUD.
2127,"To decode this message, we first
digitize it:
3, 14, 9, 7, 4, 20, 3.
"
2128,"Next we apply the inverse transformation to get
0, 11, 6, 4, 1, 17, 0,
or ALGEBRA."
2129,"Notice here that there is nothing special about either of the numbers 3 or
26."
2130,"We could have used a larger alphabet or a different shift.
"
2131,"
Cryptanalysis is concerned with deciphering a received or intercepted message."
2132,"Methods
from probability and statistics are great aids in deciphering an intercepted message; for
example, the frequency analysis of the characters appearing in the intercepted message
often makes its"
2133,"Example 7.2 Suppose we receive a message that we know was encrypted by using a shift
transformation on single letters of the 26-letter alphabet."
2134,"To find out exactly what the shift
transformation was, we must compute b in the equation f(p)"
2135,= p + b mod 26.
2136,"We can do
this using frequency analysis."
2137,"The letter E = 04 is the most commonly occurring letter
in the English language."
2138,Suppose that S
2139,"= 18 is the most commonly occurring letter in
the ciphertext."
2140,"Then we have good reason to suspect that 18 = 4 + b mod 26, or b = 14.
"
2141,"Therefore, the most likely encrypting function is
f(p)"
2142,"= p + 14 mod 26.
"
2143,"The corresponding decrypting function is
f1(p) = p + 12 mod 26.
"
2144,"It is now easy to determine whether or not our guess is correct.
"
2145,"
Simple shift codes are examples of monoalphabetic cryptosystems."
2146,"In these ciphers a
character in the enciphered message represents exactly one character in the original message.
"
2147,Such cryptosystems are not very sophisticated and are quite easy to break.
2148,"In fact, in a
simple shift as described in Example 7.1, there are only 26 possible keys."
2149,"It would be quite
easy to try them all rather than to use frequency analysis.
"
2150,Let us investigate a slightly more sophisticated cryptosystem.
2151,"Suppose that the encoding
function is given by
f(p)"
2152,"b mod 26.
"
2153,We first need to find out when a decoding function f1 exists.
2154,"Such a decoding function
exists when we can solve the equation
c = ap"
2155,"b mod 26
for p."
2156,"By Proposition 3.4, this is possible exactly when a has an inverse or, equivalently,

CHAPTER 7."
2157,"INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
83
when gcd(a, 26) = 1."
2158,"In this case
f1(p) = a1p a1b mod 26.
"
2159,"Such a cryptosystem is called an aine cryptosystem.
"
2160,Example 7.3 Let us consider the aine cryptosystem f(p)
2161,"b mod 26.
"
2162,"For this
cryptosystem to work we must choose an a Z26 that is invertible."
2163,"This is only possible if
gcd(a, 26) = 1."
2164,"Recognizing this fact, we will let a = 5 since gcd(5, 26) = 1."
2165,"It is easy to see
that a1 = 21."
2166,"Therefore, we can take our encryption function to be f(p)"
2167,"= 5p + 3 mod 26.
"
2168,"Thus, ALGEBRA is encoded as 3, 6, 7, 23, 8, 10, 3, or DGHXIKD."
2169,"The decryption function
will be
f1(p) = 21p 21  3 mod 26 = 21p + 15 mod 26.

A cryptosystem would be more secure if a ciphertext letter could represent more than
one plaintext letter."
2170,"To give an example of this type of cryptosystem, called a polyalphabetic
cryptosystem, we will generalize aine codes by using matrices."
2171,"The idea works roughly the
same as before; however, instead of encrypting one letter at a time we will encrypt pairs of
letters."
2172,"We can store a pair of letters p1 and p2 in a vector
p =
p1
p2

.
"
2173,Let A be a 2  2 invertible matrix with entries in Z26.
2174,"We can define an encoding function
by
f(p)"
2175,"= Ap + b,
where b is a fixed column vector and matrix operations are performed in Z26."
2176,"The decoding
function must be
f1(p)"
2177,"= A1p A1b.
"
2178,Example 7.4 Suppose that we wish to encode the word HELP.
2179,"The corresponding digit
string is 7, 4, 11, 15."
2180,"If
A =
3
5
1
2

,
then
A1 =
 2
21
25
3

.
"
2181,"If b = (2, 2)t, then our message is encrypted as RRGR."
2182,"The encrypted letter R represents
more than one plaintext letter.
"
2183,"
Frequency analysis can still be performed on a polyalphabetic cryptosystem, because we
have a good understanding of how pairs of letters appear in the English language."
2184,"The pair
th appears quite often; the pair qz never appears."
2185,"To avoid decryption by a third party, we
must use a larger matrix than the one we used in Example 7.4.
"
2186,"7.2 Public Key Cryptography
If traditional cryptosystems are used, anyone who knows enough to encode a message will
also know enough to decode an intercepted message."
2187,"In 1976, W. Diie and M. Hellman
proposed public key cryptography, which is based on the observation that the encryption and
decryption procedures need not have the same key."
2188,"This removes the requirement that the

CHAPTER 7."
2189,"INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
84
encoding key be kept secret."
2190,"The encoding function f must be relatively easy to compute,
but f1 must be extremely diicult to compute without some additional information, so
that someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot fi"
2191,"It is interesting to note that to date, no system has been proposed
that has been proven to be one-way; that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem,
it has never been shown to be computationally"
2192,"The RSA Cryptosystem
The rsa cryptosystem introduced by R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman in 1978, is
based on the diiculty of factoring large numbers."
2193,"Though it is not a diicult task to find
two large random primes and multiply them together, factoring a 150-digit number that is
the product of two large primes would take 100 million computers operat"
2194,"Although the algorithms have improved, factoring a number that is a product
of two large primes is still computationally prohibitive.
"
2195,"The rsa cryptosystem works as follows.
"
2196,"Suppose that we choose two random 150-
digit prime numbers p and q."
2197,"Next, we compute the product n = pq and also compute
(n)"
2198,"= m = (p 1)(q 1), where  is the Euler -function."
2199,"Now we start choosing random
integers E until we find one that is relatively prime to m; that is, we choose E such that
gcd(E, m) = 1."
2200,"Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a number D such that DE 1
(mod m)."
2201,"The numbers n and E are now made public.
"
2202,"Suppose now that person B (Bob) wishes to send person A (Alice) a message over a
public line.
"
2203,"Since E and n are known to everyone, anyone can encode messages.
"
2204,"Bob
first digitizes the message according to some scheme, say A = 00, B = 02, . ."
2205,", Z = 25."
2206,"If
necessary, he will break the message into pieces such that each piece is a positive integer
less than n. Suppose x is one of the pieces."
2207,"Bob forms the number y = xE mod n and
sends y to Alice."
2208,"For Alice to recover x, she need only compute x"
2209,"= yD mod n. Only Alice
knows D.
Example 7.5 Before exploring the theory behind the rsa cryptosystem or attempting to
use large integers, we will use some small integers just to see that the system doe"
2210,"Suppose that we wish to send some message, which when digitized is 25."
2211,"Let p = 23
and q = 29."
2212,"Then
n = pq = 667
and
(n)"
2213,= m = (p 1)(q 1)
2214,"We can let E = 487, since gcd(616, 487) = 1."
2215,"The encoded message is computed to be
25487 mod 667 = 169.
"
2216,"This computation can be reasonably done by using the method of repeated squares as
described in Chapter 4."
2217,"Using the Euclidean algorithm, we determine that"
2218,"191E = 1+151m;
therefore, the decrypting key is (n, D) = (667, 191)."
2219,"We can recover the original message
by calculating
169191 mod 667 = 25.

Now let us examine why the rsa cryptosystem works."
2220,"We know that DE 1 (mod m);

CHAPTER 7."
2221,"INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
85
hence, there exists a k such that
DE = km + 1 = k(n)"
2222,"1.
There are two cases to consider."
2223,"In the first case assume that gcd(x, n) = 1."
2224,"Then by
Theorem 6.18,
yD = (xE)D = xDE"
2225,"= xkm+1 = (x(n))kx = (1)kx = x mod n.
"
2226,"So we see that Alice recovers the original message x when she computes yD mod n.
"
2227,"For the other case, assume that gcd(x, n) = 1."
2228,"Since n = pq and x < n, we know x is
a multiple of p or a multiple of q, but not both."
2229,"We will describe the first possibility only,
since the second is entirely similar."
2230,"There is then an integer r, with r < q and x = rp."
2231,"Note
that we have gcd(x, q) = 1 and that m = (n) = (p 1)(q 1)"
2232,"Then, using
Theorem 6.18, but now mod q,
xkm = xk(p)(q) = (x(q))k(p) = (1)k(p) = 1 mod q.
"
2233,So there is an integer t such that xkm = 1
2234,"Thus, Alice also recovers the message in
this case,
yD = xkm+1 = xkmx ="
2235,"(1 + tq)x = x + tq(rp) = x + trn = x mod n.
"
2236,We can now ask how one would go about breaking the rsa cryptosystem.
2237,"To find D
given n and E, we simply need to factor n and solve for D by using the Euclidean algorithm.
"
2238,"If we had known that 667 = 23  29 in Example 7.5, we could have recovered D.
Message Verification
There is a problem of message verification in public key cryptosystems."
2239,"Since the encoding
key is public knowledge, anyone has the ability to send an encoded message.
"
2240,"If Alice
receives a message from Bob, she would like to be able to verify that it was Bob who
actually sent the message."
2241,"Suppose that Bobs encrypting key is (n, E) and his decrypting
key is (n, D)."
2242,"Also, suppose that Alices encrypting key is (n, E) and her decrypting key is
(n, D)."
2243,"Since encryption keys are public information, they can exchange coded messages at
their convenience."
2244,"Bob wishes to assure Alice that the message he is sending is authentic.
"
2245,"Before Bob sends the message x to Alice, he decrypts x with his own key:
x = xD mod n.
Anyone can change x back to x just by encryption, but only Bob has the ability to form
x."
2246,"Now Bob encrypts x with Alices encryption key to form
y = xE mod n,
a message that only Alice can decode."
2247,"Alice decodes the message and then encodes the
result with Bobs key to read the original message, a message that could have only been
sent by Bob.
Historical Note
Encrypting secret messages goes as fa"
2248,"As we know,
Julius Caesar used a simple shift code to send and receive messages."
2249,"However, the formal
study of encoding and decoding messages probably began with the Arabs in the 1400s."
2250,"In
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries mathematicians such as Alberti and Viete discovered

CHAPTER 7."
2251,"INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
86
that monoalphabetic cryptosystems offered no real security."
2252,"In the 1800s, F. W. Kasiski
established methods for breaking ciphers in which a ciphertext letter can represent more
than one plaintext letter, if the same key was used several times."
2253,"This discovery led to the
use of cryptosystems with keys that were used only a single time."
2254,"Cryptography was placed
on firm mathematical foundations by such people as W. Friedman and L. Hill in the early
part of the twentieth century.
"
2255,"The period after World War I saw the development of special-purpose machines for encrypt-
ing and decrypting messages, and mathematicians were very active in cryptography during
World War II."
2256,"Efforts to penetrate the cryptosystems of the Axis nations were organized
in England and in the United States by such notable mathematicians as Alan Turing and
A. A. Albert."
2257,"The Allies gained a tremendous advantage in World War II by breaking the
ciphers produced by the German Enigma machine and the Japanese Purple ciphers.
"
2258,"By the 1970s, interest in commercial cryptography had begun to take hold."
2259,"There was
a growing need to protect banking transactions, computer data, and electronic mail."
2260,"In
the early 1970s, ibm developed and implemented luzifer, the forerunner of the National
Bureau of Standards Data Encryption Standard (DES).
"
2261,"The concept of a public key cryptosystem, due to Diie and Hellman, is very recent (1976)."
2262,"It
was further developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman with the rsa cryptosystem (1978).
"
2263,It is not known how secure any of these systems are.
2264,"The trapdoor knapsack cryptosys-
tem, developed by Merkle and Hellman, has been broken.
"
2265,"It is still an open question
whether or not the rsa system can be broken."
2266,"In 1991, rsa Laboratories published a list
of semiprimes (numbers with exactly two prime factors) with a cash prize for whoever was

Algebraic Coding Theory
Coding theory is an application of algebra that has become increasingly important over the
last several decades."
2356,"When we transmit data, we are concerned about sending a message over
a channel that could be affected by noise."
2357,"We wish to be able to encode and decode the
information in a manner that will allow the detection, and possibly the correction, of errors
caused by noise."
2358,"This situation arises in many areas of communications, including radio,
telephone, television, computer communications, and digital media technology."
2359,"Probability,
combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra, and polynomial rings over finite fields all play
important roles in coding theory.
"

Let us examine a simple model of a communications system for transmitting and receiving
coded messages (Figure 8.1).

2363,"These messages are encoded into codewords, consisting of binary n-
tuples, by a device called an encoder."
2364,The message is transmitted and then decoded.
2365,"We
will consider the occurrence of errors during transmission."
2366,"An error occurs if there is a
change in one or more bits in the codeword."
2367,"A decoding scheme is a method that either
converts an arbitrarily received n-tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error
message for that n-tuple."
2368,"If the received message is a codeword (one of the special n-tuples
allowed to be transmitted), then the decoded message must be the unique message that
was encoded into the codeword."
2369,"For received non-codewords, the decoding scheme will give
an error indication, or, if we are more clever, will actually try to correct the error and
reconstruct the original message."
2370,"Our goal is to transmit error-free messages as cheaply
and quickly as possible.
"
2371,"Example 8.2 One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to
compare the received copies with one another."
2372,"Suppose that the message to be encoded is
a binary n-tuple (x1, x2, . . ."
2373,"The message is encoded into a binary 3n-tuple by simply
repeating the message three times:
(x1, x2, . . ."
2374,", xn) 7(x1, x2, . . ."
2375,", xn, x1, x2, . . ."
2376,", xn, x1, x2, . . ."
2377,"To decode the message, we choose as the ith digit the one that appears in the ith place
in at least two of the three transmissions."
2378,"For example, if the original message is (0110),

then the transmitted message will be (0110 0110 0110)."
2380,"If there is a transmission error in
the fifth digit, then the received codeword will be (0110 1110 0110), which will be correctly
decoded as (0110).6 This triple-repetition method will automatically d"
2381,"We will see that it is
possible to find an encoding scheme that will encode a message of n bits into m bits with
m much smaller than 3n.
"
2382,"
Example 8.3 Even parity, a commonly used coding scheme, is much more eicient than the
simple repetition scheme."
2383,"The ascii (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
coding system uses binary 8-tuples, yielding 28 = 256 possible 8-tuples."
2384,"However, only seven
bits are needed since there are only 27 = 128 ascii characters."
2385,"What can or should be done
with the extra bit?"
2386,"Using the full eight bits, we can detect single transmission errors."
2387,"For
example, the ascii codes for A, B, and C are
A = 6510 = 010000012,
B = 6610 = 010000102,
C = 6710 = 010000112.
"
2388,"Notice that the leftmost bit is always set to 0; that is, the 128 ascii characters have codes
000000002 = 010,
...
011111112 = 12710.
"
2389,The bit can be used for error checking on the other seven bits.
2390,"It is set to either 0 or 1
so that the total number of 1 bits in the representation of a character is even."
2391,"Using even
parity, the codes for A, B, and C now become
A = 010000012,
B = 010000102,
C = 110000112.
"
2392,"Suppose an A is sent and a transmission error in the sixth bit is caused by noise over the
communication channel so that (0100 0101) is received."
2393,"We know an error has occurred since
the received word has an odd number of 1s, and we can now request that the codeword be
transmitted again."
2394,"When used for error checking, the leftmost bit is called a parity check
bit.
"
2395,"By far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the
addition of a parity bit."
2396,"Typically, a computer stores information in m-tuples called words.
"
2397,"Common word lengths are 8, 16, and 32 bits."
2398,"One bit in the word is set aside as the parity
check bit, and is not used to store information."
2399,"This bit is set to either 0 or 1, depending
on the number of 1s in the word.
"
2400,"Adding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a
single bit either increases or decreases the number of 1s by one, and in either case the parity
has been changed "
2401,"(We could also
construct an error detection scheme based on odd parity; that is, we could set the parity
check bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of 1s.)
"
2402,"
The even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks."
2403,"First, multiple

errors are not detectable."
2405,"Suppose an A is sent and the first and seventh bits are changed
from 0 to 1."
2406,"The received word is a codeword, but will be decoded into a C instead of an A.
Second, we do not have the ability to correct errors."
2407,"If the 8-tuple (1001 1000) is received,
we know that an error has occurred, but we have no idea which bit has been changed."
2408,"We
will now investigate a coding scheme that will not only allow us to detect transmission errors
but will actually correct the errors.
"
2409,"Example 8.4 Suppose that our original message is either a 0 or a 1, and that 0 encodes
to (000) and 1 encodes to (111)."
2410,"If only a single error occurs during transmission, we can
detect and correct the error."
2411,"For example, if a (101) is received, then the second bit must
have been changed from a 1 to a 0."
2412,"The originally transmitted codeword must have been
(111)."
2413,"This method will detect and correct all single errors.

3-tuple differs from each original codeword.
"
2417,"
Maximum-Likelihood Decoding
The coding scheme presented in Example 8.4 is not a complete solution to the problem
because it does not account for the possibility of multiple errors."
2418,"For example, either a
(000) or a (111) could be sent and a (001) received."
2419,"We have no means of deciding from the
received word whether there was a single error in the third bit or two errors, one in the first
bit and one in the second."
2420,"No matter what coding scheme is used, an incorrect message
could be received."
2421,"We could transmit a (000), have errors in all three bits, and receive
the codeword (111)."
2422,"It is important to make explicit assumptions about the likelihood and
distribution of transmission errors so that, in a particular application, it will be known
whether a given error detection scheme "
2423,"We will assume that transmission
errors are rare, and, that when they do occur, they occur independently in each bit; that is,
if p is the probability of an error in one bit and q is the probability o"

that is, we assume that the receiver uses maximum-likelihood decoding."

Block Codes
If we are to develop eicient error-detecting and error-correcting codes, we will need more
sophisticated mathematical tools."
2447,"Group theory will allow faster methods of encoding and
decoding messages."
2448,"A code is an (n, m)-block code if the information that is to be coded
can be divided into blocks of m binary digits, each of which can be encoded into n binary
digits."

2451,A codeword is any element in the image of E.
2452,"We also require that E be one-to-one so that
two information blocks will not be encoded into the same codeword."
2453,"If our code is to be
error-correcting, then D must be onto.
"
2454,"Example 8.9 The even-parity coding system developed to detect single errors in ascii
characters is an (8, 7)-block code."
2455,"The encoding function is
E(x7, x6, . . ."

2461,"The Hamming distance or
distance, d(x, y), between x and y is the number of bits in which x and y differ."
2462,"The distance
between two codewords is the minimum number of transmission errors required to change
one codeword into the other."
2463,"The minimum distance for a code, dmin, is the minimum of
all distances d(x, y), where x and y are distinct codewords."
2464,"The weight, w(x), of a binary
codeword x is the number of 1s in x."
2465,"Clearly, w(x) = d(x, 0), where 0 = (00    0).
"
2466,"Let x = (10101), y = (11010), and z = (00011) be all of the codewords in
some code C. Then we have the following Hamming distances:
d(x, y) = 4,
d(x, z) = 3,
d(y, z) = 3.

distances between all codewords in the code."

fact to our advantage.

(1101) and an error occurs in the rightmost bit, then (1100) will be received."
2481,"Since (1100) is
a codeword, the decoder will decode (1100) as the transmitted message."

not very appropriate for error detection."

of errors, then we can detect multiple errors when a code has a minimum distance that is
greater than or equal to 3.

2502,"Then C can correct any n or fewer
errors."

Proof."
2504,"Suppose that a codeword x is sent and the word y is received with at most n errors.
"
2505,"Then d(x, y) n."
2506,"If z is any codeword other than x, then
2n + 1 d(x, z) d(x, y) + d(y, z) n + d(y, z).

"
2507,"ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY
98
Hence, d(y, z) n + 1"
2508,"and y will be correctly decoded as x.
Now suppose that x is
transmitted and y is received and that at least one error has occurred, but not more than
2n errors."
2509,"Then 1 d(x, y) 2n."
2510,"Since the minimum distance between codewords is 2n+1,
y cannot be a codeword."
2511,"Consequently, the code can detect between 1 and 2n errors.

"
2517,"The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, by MacWilliams and Sloane"
2518,"[5], published in 1977,
already contained over 1500 references."
2519,"Linear codes (Reed-Muller (32, 6)-block codes) were
used on NASAs Mariner space probes."
2520,"More recent space probes such as Voyager have used
what are called convolution codes."

"
2522,"8.2 Linear Codes
To gain more knowledge of a particular code and develop more eicient techniques of encod-
ing, decoding, and error detection, we need to add additional structure to our codes."
2523,"One
way to accomplish this is to require that the code also be a group."
2524,"A group code is a code
that is also a subgroup of Zn
2.
To check that a code is a group code, we need only verify one thing."
2525,"If we add any
two elements in the code, the result must be an n-tuple that is again in the code."
2526,"It is not
necessary to check that the inverse of the n-tuple is in the code, since every codeword is its
own inverse, nor is it necessary to check that 0 is a codeword."
2527,"For instance,
(11000101) + (11000101) = (00000000).
"
2528,"Example 8.16 Suppose that we have a code that consists of the following 7-tuples:

We are now in a position to characterize all cyclic groups.
"
2931,"Theorem 9.7 All cyclic groups of infinite order are isomorphic to Z.
Proof."
2932,"Let G be a cyclic group with infinite order and suppose that a is a generator of G.
Define a map  : Z G by  : n 7an."
2933,"Then
(m + n) = am+n = aman = (m)(n).
"
2934,"To show that  is injective, suppose that m and n are two elements in Z, where m"
2935,"We
can assume that m > n."
2936,We must show that am = an.
2937,"Let us suppose the contrary; that
is, am = an."
2938,"In this case amn = e, where m n > 0, which contradicts the fact that a
has infinite order."
2939,"Our map is onto since any element in G can be written as an for some
integer n and (n) = an.
"
2940,"
Theorem 9.8 If G is a cyclic group of order n, then G is isomorphic to Zn.
Proof."
2941,Let G be a cyclic group of order n generated by a and define a map  :
2942,"Zn G

"
2943,"The proof that  is an isomorphism is one of the
end-of-chapter exercises.
"
2944,"
Corollary 9.9 If G is a group of order p, where p is a prime number, then G is isomorphic
to Zp.
Proof."
2945,"The proof is a direct result of Corollary 6.12.

The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups; however, it makes sense to
consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic."
2946,"We state this result in the
following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise.
"
2947,"The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relation on the class
of all groups.
"
2948,"Hence, we can modify our goal of classifying all groups to classifying all groups up to
isomorphism; that is, we will consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.
"
2949,"Cayleys Theorem
Cayley proved that if G is a group, it is isomorphic to a group of permutations on some set;
hence, every group is a permutation group."
2950,"Cayleys Theorem is what we call a represen-
tation theorem."
2951,"The aim of representation theory is to find an isomorphism of some group
G that we wish to study into a group that we know a great deal about, such as a group of

2959,"Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
"
2960,Let G be a group.
2961,"We must find a group of permutations G that is isomorphic
to G. For any g G, define a function g : G G by g(a)"
2962,"We claim that g is a
permutation of G. To show that g is one-to-one, suppose that g(a) = g(b)."
2963,"Then
ga = g(a) = g(b) = gb.
"
2964,"Hence, a = b."
2965,"To show that g is onto, we must prove that for each a G, there is a b such
that g(b) = a. Let b = g1a.
"
2966,"Now we are ready to define our group G. Let
G = {g : g G}.
"
2967,"We must show that G is a group under composition of functions and find an isomorphism
between G and G. We have closure under composition of functions since
(g h)(a) = g(ha) = gha = gh(a).
"
2968,"Also,
e(a) = ea = a
and
(g1 g)(a) = g1(ga) = g1ga = a = e(a).
"
2969,We can define an isomorphism from G to G by  : g 7g.
2970,"The group operation is
preserved since
(gh)"
2971,"= gh = gh = (g)(h).
"
2972,"It is also one-to-one, because if (g)(a) = (h)(a), then
ga = ga = ha = ha.
"
2973,"Hence, g = h. That  is onto follows from the fact that (g)"

The isomorphism g 7g is known as the left regular representation of G.

2985,"Rather than studying a large group G, it is often easier to study the

If (G, ) and (H, ) are groups, then we can make the Cartesian product of G and H i"
2986,"As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs (g, h) G "
2987,"H where g G and

2988,"We can define a binary operation on G  H by
(g1, h1)(g2, h2) = (g1  g2, h1 h2);
that is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in G and elements in the
second coordinate as we do "
2989,Proposition 9.13 Let G and H be groups.
2990,"The set G  H is a group under the operation
(g1, h1)(g2, h2)"
2991,"= (g1g2, h1h2) where g1, g2 G and h1, h2 H.
Proof."
2992,Clearly the binary operation defined above is closed.
2993,"If eG and eH are the identities
of the groups G and H respectively, then (eG, eH) is the identity of G "
2994,"H. The inverse of
(g, h) G "
2995,"H is (g1, h1)."
2996,"The fact that the operation is associative follows directly from
the associativity of G and H.

Example 9.14 Let R be the group of real numbers under addition."
2997,"The Cartesian product
of R with itself, RR = R2, is also a group, in which the group operation is just addition in

"
3016,The group operation is the exclusive or of two binary n-tuples.

3020,"If g and h have finite orders r and s respectively, then
the order of (g, h) in G "

3023,"Then
(g, h)m = (gm, hm) = (eG, eH)
(gn, hn) = (g, h)n = (eG, eH).
"
3024,"Hence, n must divide m, and n m."
3025,"However, by the second equation, both r and s must
divide n; therefore, n is a common multiple of r and s. Since m is the least common multiple
of r and s, m n."

3045,"We will prove the
contrapositive; that is, we will show that if gcd(m, n) = d > 1, then ZmZn cannot be cyclic.

Normal Subgroups and Factor Groups
If H is a subgroup of a group G, then right cosets are not always the same as left cosets;
that is, it is not always the case that gH"
3200,= Hg for all g G.
3201,"The subgroups for which this
property holds play a critical role in group theorythey allow for the construction of a new
class of groups, called factor or quotient groups."
3202,"Factor groups may be studied directly or
by using homomorphisms, a generalization of isomorphisms."
3203,"We will study homomorphisms
in Chapter 11.
10.1 Factor Groups and Normal Subgroups
Normal Subgroups
A subgroup H of a group G is normal in G if gH"
3204,"= Hg for all g G. That is, a normal
subgroup of a group G is one in which the right and left cosets are precisely the same.
"
3205,Example 10.1 Let G be an abelian group.
3206,"Every subgroup H of G is a normal subgroup.
"
3207,"Since gh = hg for all g G and h H, it will always be the case that gH"
3208,"= Hg.

Example 10.2"
3209,Let H be the subgroup of S3 consisting of elements (1) and (12).
3210,"Since
(123)H = {(1 2 3), (1 3)}
and
H(1 2 3) = {(1 2 3), (2 3)},
H cannot be a normal subgroup of S3."
3211,"However, the subgroup N, consisting of the permu-
tations (1), (1 2 3), and (1 3 2), is normal since the cosets of N are
N = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}
(1 2)N = N(1 2) = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)}.

The following theorem is fundamental to our understanding of normal subgroups.

3219,"Since N is normal in G, gN = Ng for all g G. Hence, for a given
g G and n N, there exists an n in N such that gn = ng."

3221,"Let g G. Since gNg1 N, we need only show N gNg1."
3222,"For n N,
g1ng ="
3223,"g1n(g1)1 N. Hence, g1ng = n for some n N."
3224,"Therefore, n = gng1 is
in gNg1.
"
3225,Suppose that gNg1 = N for all g G.
3226,"Then for any n N there exists an
n N such that gng1 = n. Consequently, gn = ng or gN Ng."
3227,"Similarly, Ng gN.

Factor Groups
If N is a normal subgroup of a group G, then the cosets of N in G form a group G/N under
the operation (aN)(bN) = abN. This group is called the factor or quotient grou"
3228,"Our first task is to prove that G/N is indeed a group.
"
3229,Theorem 10.4 Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G.
3230,"The cosets of N in G form a
group G/N of order [G : N].
Proof."
3231,"The group operation on G/N is (aN)(bN) = abN. This operation must be shown
to be well-defined; that is, group multiplication must be independent of the choice of coset
representative."
3232,"Let aN = bN and cN = dN. We must show that
(aN)(cN) = acN = bdN = (bN)(dN).
"
3233,Then a = bn1 and c
3234,"= dn2 for some n1 and n2 in N. Hence,
acN = bn1dn2N
= bn1dN
= bn1Nd
= bNd
= bdN.

gN. The order of G/N is, of cour"
3235,"Example 10.5 Consider the normal subgroup of S3, N = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}."

strange; however, notice that S3/N is a smaller group."

amount of information about S3."
3241,"Actually, N = A3, the group of even permutations, and
(1 2)N = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)} is the set of odd permutations."

10.2 The Simplicity of the Alternating Group
Of special interest are groups with no nontrivial normal subgroups."

are not so easily found."

for n 5."

"

Proof.
"
3270,"To show that the 3-cycles generate An, we need only show that any pair of
transpositions can be written as the product of 3-cycles."
3271,"Since (a, b) = (b, a), every pair of

(j, a, b) = (i, j, b)2(i, j, a)
(a, b, c) = (i, j, a)2(i, j, c)(i, j, b)2(i, j, a).
"
3278,"Now suppose that N is a nontrivial normal subgroup of An for n 3 such that N contains
a 3-cycle of the form (i, j, a)."
3279,"Using the normality of N, we see that
[(i, j)(a, k)](i, j, a)2[(i, j)(a, k)]1 = (i, j, k)

3398,"For any element g G1, (g1) ="
3399,"If H1 is a subgroup of G1, then (H1) is a subgroup of G2;
4."
3400,"If H2 is a subgroup of G2, then 1(H2)"
3401,"= {g G1 : (g) H2} is a subgroup of G1.
"
3402,"Furthermore, if H2 is normal in G2, then 1(H2) is normal in G1.
Proof."
3403,"(1) Suppose that e and e are the identities of G1 and G2, respectively; then
e(e)"
3404,"By cancellation, (e) = e.
(2) This statement follows from the fact that
(g1)(g) = (g1g) = (e)"
3405,"= e.
(3) The set (H1) is nonempty since the identity of G2 is in (H1)."
3406,"Suppose that H1
is a subgroup of G1 and let x and y be in (H1)."
3407,"There exist elements a, b H1 such that
(a) = x and (b) = y."
3408,"Since
xy1 = (a)[(b)]1 = (ab1) (H1),
(H1) is a subgroup of G2 by Proposition 3.31.
"
3409,"(4) Let H2 be a subgroup of G2 and define H1 to be 1(H2); that is, H1 is the set of
all g G1 such that (g) H2."
3410,The identity is in H1 since (e)
3411,"If a and b are in H1,

normal subgroup of G.
Example 11.6 Let us examine the homomorphism  : GL2(R) Rdefined by A 7
det(A)."
3421,"Since 1 is the identity of R, the kernel of this homomorphism is all 2  2 matrices
having determinant one."

3425,"Notice that ker  = Z.

Example 11.8 Suppose that we wish to determine all possible homomorphisms  from Z7

3426,"Since the kernel of  must be a subgroup of Z7, there are only two possible kernels,
{0} and all of Z7."
3427,The image of a subgroup of Z7 must be a subgroup of Z12.
3428,"Hence, there
is no injective homomorphism; otherwise, Z12 would have a subgroup of order 7, which
is impossible."
3429,"Consequently, the only possible homomorphism from Z7 to Z12 is the one
mapping all elements to zero.
"
3430,"
Example 11.9 Let G be a group."
3431,"Suppose that g G and  is the homomorphism from Z
to G given by (n) = gn."
3432,"If the order of g is infinite, then the kernel of this homomorphism
is {0} since  maps Z onto the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g."
3433,"However, if the order
of g is finite, say n, then the kernel of  is nZ.

11.2 The Isomorphism Theorems
Although it is not evident at first, factor groups correspond exactly to homomorphic images,
and "
3434,"We already know that with every
group homomorphism  :"
3435,"G H we can associate a normal subgroup of G, ker ."
3436,"The con-
verse is also true; that is, every normal subgroup of a group G gives rise to homomorphism
of groups.
"
3437,"Let H be a normal subgroup of G. Define the natural or canonical homomorphism
 : G G/H
by
(g)"
3438,"= gH.
This is indeed a homomorphism, since
(g1g2) = g1g2H = g1Hg2H = (g1)(g2).
"
3439,"The kernel of this homomorphism is H. The following theorems describe the relationships
between group homomorphisms, normal subgroups, and factor groups.
"
3440,Theorem 11.10 First Isomorphism Theorem.
3441,"If  : G H is a group homomorphism
with K = ker , then K is normal in G. Let  : G G/K be the canonical homomorphism.
"
3442,"Then there exists a unique isomorphism  : G/K (G) such that  = .
Proof."
3443,"We already know that K is normal in G. Define  : G/K (G) by (gK) = (g).
"
3444,We first show that  is a well-defined map.
3445,"If g1K = g2K, then for some k K, g1k = g2;
consequently,
(g1K) = (g1)"
3446,= (g1)(k) = (g1k) = (g2)
3447,"Thus,  does not depend on the choice of coset representatives and the map  : G/K (G)
is uniquely defined since  = ."
3448,We must also show that  is a homomorphism.

= (g1K)(g2K).
"
3451,"Clearly,  is onto (G)."
3452,"To show that  is one-to-one, suppose that (g1K) = (g2K).
"
3453,Then (g1) = (g2).
3454,"This implies that (g1
1 g2) = e, or g1
1 g2 is in the kernel of ; hence,

orems."

Example 11.11 Let G be a cyclic group with generator g. Define a map  : Z G by
n 7gn."
3456,"This map is a surjective homomorphism since
(m + n) = gm+n = gmgn = (m)(n).
"
3457,Clearly  is onto.
3458,"If |g| = m, then gm = e. Hence, ker  = mZ and Z/"
3459,"ker  = Z/mZ = G.
"
3460,"On the other hand, if the order of g is infinite, then ker  = 0 and  is an isomorphism of
G and Z."
3461,"Hence, two cyclic groups are isomorphic exactly when they have the same order.
"
3462,"Up to isomorphism, the only cyclic groups are Z and Zn.

Theorem 11.12
Second Isomorphism Theorem."
3463,"Let H be a subgroup of a group G
(not necessarily normal in G) and N a normal subgroup of G."
3464,"Then HN is a subgroup of
G, H N is a normal subgroup of H, and
H/H N = HN/N.
Proof."
3465,"We will first show that HN = {hn : h H, n N} is a subgroup of G. Suppose
that h1n1, h2n2 HN."
3466,"Since N is normal, (h2)1n1h2 N. So
(h1n1)(h2n2) = h1h2((h2)1n1h2)n2
is in HN."
3467,"The inverse of hn HN is in HN since
(hn)1 = n1h1 = h1(hn1h1).
"
3468,"Next, we prove that H N is normal in H.
Let h H and n H N.
"
3469,"Then
h1nh H since each element is in H. Also, h1nh N since N is normal in G; therefore,
h1nh H N.
Now define a map  from H to HN/N by h 7hN."
3470,"The map  is onto, since any coset
hnN = hN is the image of h in H. We also know that  is a homomorphism"
3471,"because
(hh) = hhN = hNhN = (h)(h).
"
3472,"By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image of  is isomorphic to H/ ker ; that is,
HN/N = (H) = H/ ker .

Since

HN/N = (H) = H/H N.

3477,"Let H be a subgroup of G containing N. Since N is normal in H, H/N is a factor
group."
3478,"Let aN and bN be elements of H/N. Then (aN)(b1N) = ab1N H/N; hence,
H/N is a subgroup of G/N.
Let S be a subgroup of G/N. This subgroup is a set of cosets of N."
3479,"If H = {g G :
gN S}, then for h1, h2 H, we have that (h1N)(h2N) ="
3480,"h1h2N S and h1
1 N S.
Therefore, H must be a subgroup of G. Clearly, H contains N. Therefore, S = H/N.
Consequently, the map H 7H/N is onto.
"
3481,Suppose that H1 and H2 are subgroups of G containing N
3482,"such that H1/N = H2/N.
If h1 H1, then h1N H1/N. Hence, h1N = h2N H2 for some h2 in H2."
3483,"However,
since N is contained in H2, we know that h1 H2 or H1 H2."
3484,"Similarly, H2 H1."
3485,"Since
H1 = H2, the map H 7H/N is one-to-one.
Suppose that H is normal in G and N is a subgroup of H."
3486,"Then it is easy to verify
that the map G/N G/H defined by gN"
3487,7gH is a homomorphism.
3488,"The kernel of this
homomorphism is H/N, which proves that H/N is normal in G/N.
Conversely, suppose that H/N is normal in G/N. The homomorphism given by

subgroups."

The Structure of Groups
The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism; that is, given a

to Zn; hence, we know all finite cyclic groups."

distinguish between groups in special cases.

groups with sequences of subgroups."

then G is a solvable group."

of groups, solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial
equations.

The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups depends on several
lemmas.
"
3941,Lemma 13.6 Let G be a finite abelian group of order n.
3942,"If p is a prime that divides n,
then G contains an element of order p.
Proof."
3943,We will prove this lemma by induction.
3944,"If n = 1, then there is nothing to show.
"
3945,"Now suppose that the lemma is true for all groups of order k, where k < n. Furthermore,
let p be a prime that divides n.
"
3946,"If G has no proper nontrivial subgroups, then G = a, where a is any element other
than the identity."
3947,"By Exercise 4.5.39, the order of G must be prime."
3948,"Since p divides n, we
know that p = n, and G contains p 1 elements of order p.
"
3949,Now suppose that G contains a nontrivial proper subgroup H. Then 1 < |H| <
3950,"If
p | |H|, then H contains an element of order p by induction and the lemma is true."
3951,"Suppose
that p does not divide the order of H. Since G is abelian, it must be the case that H is a
normal subgroup of G, and |G| = |H|  |G/H|."
3952,"Consequently, p must divide |G/H|."
3953,"Since
|G/H| < |G| = n, we know that G/H contains an element aH of order p by the induction
hypothesis."
3954,"Thus,
H = (aH)p = apH,
and ap H but a /H."
3955,"If |H| = r, then p and r are relatively prime, and there exist
integers s and t"
3956,such that sp + tr = 1.
3957,"Furthermore, the order of ap must divide r, and
(ap)r = (ar)p = 1.
"
3958,We claim that ar has order p.
3959,We must show that ar = 1.
3960,Suppose ar = 1.
3961,"Then
a = asp+tr
= aspatr
= (ap)s(ar)t
= (ap)s1
= (ap)s.
"
3962,"Since ap H, it must be the case that a = (ap)s H, which is a contradiction."
3963,"Therefore,
ar = 1 is an element of order p in G.

3964,"We will prove Cauchys Theorem in Chapter 15.

3966,"If |G| = pn then by Lagranges theorem, then the order of any g G must divide

it follows that gaibi must be in Gi.

3991,"Let gi = gaibi.

"
3993,"Therefore, G = G1G2    Gk is an internal direct product of subgroups.

If remains for us to determine the possible structure of each pi-group Gi in Lemma 13.8.
"
3995,"Lemma 13.9 Let G be a finite abelian p-group and suppose that g G has maximal order.
"
3996,"Then G is isomorphic to g H for some subgroup H of G.
Proof."
3997,"By Lemma 13.7, we may assume that the order of G is pn."
3998,"We shall induct on n.
"
3999,"If n = 1, then G is cyclic of order p and must be generated by g. Suppose now that the
statement of the lemma holds for all integers k with 1 k < n and let g be of maximal
order in G, say |g| = pm."
4000,"Then apm = e for all a G. Now choose h in G such that h /g,
where h has the smallest possible order."
4001,"Certainly such an h exists; otherwise, G = gand
we are done."
4002,"Let H = h.
We claim that gH = {e}."
4003,It suices to show that |H| =
4004,"Since |hp| = |h|/p, the
order of hp is smaller than the order of h and must be in gby the minimality of h; that
is, hp = gr for some number r."
4005,"Hence,
(gr)pm1 = (hp)pm1 = hpm = e,
and the order of gr must be less than or equal to pm1."
4006,"Therefore, gr cannot generate g.
Notice that p must occur as a factor of r, say r = ps, and hp = gr"

4012,"THE STRUCTURE OF GROUPS

"
4013,"Now we will show that the order of gH in the factor group G/H must be the same as
the order of g in G."
4014,"If |gH| < |g| = pm, then
H = (gH)pm1 = gpm1H;
hence, gpm1 must be in gH = {e}, which contradicts the fact that the order of g is pm.
"

induction hypothesis,
G/H = gH K/H

Group Actions
Group actions generalize group multiplication."
4135,"If G is a group and X is an arbitrary set, a
group action of an element g G and x X is a product, gx, living in X. Many problems
in algebra are best be attacked via group actions."
4136,"For example, the proofs of the Sylow
theorems and of Burnsides Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are
formulated in terms of group actions.
"
4137,"14.1 Groups Acting on Sets
Let X be a set and G be a group."
4138,"A (left) action of G on X is a map G  X X given
by (g, x) 7gx, where
1."
4139,"ex = x for all x X;
2. (g1g2)x = g1(g2x) for all x X and all g1, g2 G.
Under these considerations X is called a G-set."
4140,"Notice that we are not requiring X to be
related to G in any way."
4141,"It is true that every group G acts on every set X by the trivial
action (g, x) 7x; however, group actions are more interesting if the set X is somehow
related to the group"
4142,"G.
Example 14.1 Let G = GL2(R) and X = R2."
4143,Then G acts on X by left multiplication.
4144,"If
v R2 and I is the identity matrix, then Iv = v. If A and B are 2  2 invertible matrices,
then (AB)v = A(Bv) since matrix multiplication is associative.
"
4145,"
Example 14.2 Let G = D4 be the symmetry group of a square."
4146,"If X = {1, 2, 3, 4} is the set
of vertices of the square, then we can consider D4 to consist of the following permutations:
{(1), (1 3), (2 4), (1 4 3 2), (1 2 3 4), (1 2)(3 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1 3)(2 4)"
4147,The elements of D4 act on X as functions.
4148,"The permutation (1 3)(2 4) acts on vertex 1 by
sending it to vertex 3, on vertex 2 by sending it to vertex 4, and so on."
4149,"It is easy to see that
the axioms of a group action are satisfied.
"
4150,"
In general, if X is any set and G is a subgroup of SX, the group of all permutations

Example 14.3 If we let X = G, then every group G acts on itself by the left regular
representation; that is, (g, x) 7g(x) = gx, where g is left multiplication:
e  x = ex = ex = x
(gh"
4152,"x = ghx = ghx = g(hx) = g  (h  x).

Example 14.4 Let G be a group and suppose that X = G."
4154,"If H is a subgroup of G, then
G is an H-set under conjugation; that is, we can define an action of H on G,
H  G G,

Example 14.5 Let H be a subgroup of G and LH the set of left cosets of H. The set LH
is a G-set under the action
(g, xH) 7gxH.
Again, it is easy to see that the first axiom is true."
4157,"Since (gg)xH = g(gxH), the second
axiom is also true.

4158,"
If G acts on a set X and x, y X, then x is said to be G-equivalent to y if there exists
a g G such that gx = y. We write x G y or x y if two elements are G-equivalent.
"
4159,Proposition 14.6 Let X be a G-set.
4160,"Then G-equivalence is an equivalence relation on X.
Proof."
4161,"The relation is reflexive since ex = x. Suppose that x y for x, y X."
4162,"Then
there exists a g such that gx = y."
4163,"In this case g1y = x; hence, y x."
4164,"To show that the
relation is transitive, suppose that x y and y z."
4165,"Then there must exist group elements
g and h such that gx = y and hy = z."
4166,"So z = hy = (hg)x, and x is equivalent to z.

If X is a G-set, then each partition of X associated with G-equivalence is called an orbit
of X under G."
4167,"We will denote the orbit that contains an element x of X by Ox.
"
4168,"Example 14.7 Let G be the permutation group defined by
G = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2), (4 5), (1 2 3)(4 5), (1 3 2)(4 5)}

Now suppose that G is a group acting on a set X and let g be an element of G. The

Before we apply Burnsides Theorem to switching-theory problems, let us examine the

that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the
square."

the colors black and white, respectively."

circuit a large number of different switching functions can be constructed."

inputs and a single output, we can construct 65,536 different switching functions."

Consider a switching function with three possible inputs, a, b, and c.

output values for the inputs a, b, and c, so when we consider equivalent switching functions,
we are permuting 23 possible outputs, not just three input values."

Case 2.
Suppose the order of no centralizer subgroup is divisible by p."
4484,"Then p divides
"
4485,"[G : C(xi)], the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation; hence, p must divide
the center of G, Z(G)."
4486,"Since Z(G) is abelian, it must have a subgroup of order p by the
Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups."
4487,"Therefore, the center of G contains an
element of order p.

Corollary 15.2 Let G be a finite group."
4488,"Then G is a p-group if and only if |G| = pn.
"
4489,Example 15.3 Let us consider the group A5.
4490,We know that |A5| = 60 = 22  3  5.
4491,"By
Cauchys Theorem, we are guaranteed that A5 has subgroups of orders 2, 3 and 5."
4492,"The
Sylow Theorems will give us even more information about the possible subgroups of A5.
"
4493,"
We are now ready to state and prove the first of the Sylow Theorems."
4494,"The proof is very
similar to the proof of Cauchys Theorem.
"
4495,Theorem 15.4 First Sylow Theorem.
4496,"Let G be a finite group and p a prime such that
pr divides |G|."
4497,"Then G contains a subgroup of order pr.
Proof.
"
4498,We induct on the order of G once again.
4499,"If |G| = p, then we are done."
4500,"Now
suppose that the order of G is n with n > p and that the theorem is true for all groups of
order less than n, where p divides n. We shall apply the class equation once again:
|G| ="
4501,[G : C(x1)]
4502,+   
4503,"[G : C(xk)].
"
4504,"First suppose that p does not divide [G : C(xi)] for some i. Then pr | |C(xi)|, since pr
divides |G| = |C(xi)| "
4505,[G : C(xi)].
4506,"Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to C(xi).
"
4507,"Hence, we may assume that p divides [G : C(xi)] for all i."
4508,"Since p divides |G|, the class
equation says that p must divide |Z(G)|; hence, by Cauchys Theorem, Z(G) has an element
of order p, say g. Let N be the group generated by g. Clearly, N is a normal subg"
4509,"By
the induction hypothesis, G/N contains a subgroup H of order pr1."
4510,"The inverse image of
H under the canonical homomorphism  : G G/N is a subgroup of order pr in G.

A Sylow p-subgroup P of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G. To prove the other
two Sylow Theorems,"
4511,"For a group G, let S be the collection of all subgroups of G. For any
subgroup H, S is a H-set, where H acts on S by conjugation."
4512,"That is, we have an action
H  S S
defined by
h  K 7hKh1
for K in S.
"
4513,"The set
N(H) = {g G : gHg1 = H}
is a subgroup of G called the the normalizer of H in G. Notice that H is a normal subgroup
of N(H)."
4514,"In fact, N(H) is the largest subgroup of G in which H is normal.
"
4515,"Lemma 15.5 Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G and let x have as its order
a power of p."

4517,"Certainly x N(P), and the cyclic subgroup, xPN(P)/P, has as its order a
power of p."
4518,"By the Correspondence Theorem there exists a subgroup H of N(P) containing
P such that H/P = xP."
4519,"Since |H| = |P|  |xP|, the order of H must be a power of p.
"
4520,"However, P is a Sylow p-subgroup contained in H. Since the order of P is the largest power
of p dividing |G|, H = P. Therefore, H/P is the trivial subgroup and xP = P, or x P.

H-conjugates of K and the right cosets of N(K) H in H.

Theorem 15.7 Second Sylow Theorem."
4528,"Let G be a finite group and p a prime dividing
|G|."
4529,Then all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.
4530,"That is, if P1 and P2 are two Sylow
p-subgroups, there exists a g G such that gP1g1 = P2.
Proof."
4531,Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and suppose that |G| = prm with |P| = pr.
4532,"Let
S = {P = P1, P2, . ."
4533,", Pk}

4536,[G : N(P)]
4537,"= |N(P)|  k.
"
4538,"Since pr divides |N(P)|, p cannot divide k.
Given any other Sylow p-subgroup Q, we must show that Q S.
Consider the Q-
conjugacy classes of each Pi."
4539,"Clearly, these conjugacy classes partition S. The size of the
partition containing Pi is"
4540,[Q : N(Pi) Q]

that |Q| ="
4542,[Q : N(Pi) Q]|N(Pi) Q|.
4543,"Thus, [Q : N(Pi) Q] must be a divisor of |Q| = pr.
"
4544,"Hence, the number of conjugates in every equivalence class of the partition is a power of
p."
4545,"However, since p does not divide k, one of these equivalence classes must contain only a
single Sylow p-subgroup, say Pj."
4546,"In this case, x1Pjx = Pj for all x Q. By Lemma 15.5,
Pj = Q.

Theorem 15.8
Third Sylow Theorem."
4547,"Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime
dividing the order of G."
4548,"Then the number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 (mod p)
and divides |G|.
"

4551,"From the proof of the Second Sylow Theorem, the only P-conjugate of P
is itself and the order of the other P-conjugacy classes is a power of p."
4552,"Each P-conjugacy
class contributes a positive power of p toward |S| except the equivalence class {P}."
4553,"Since
|S| is the sum of positive powers of p and 1, |S| 1 (mod p).

there can be only one orbit under this action."

Historical Note
Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway (now Oslo)."
4561,"After
attending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school."
4562,"In 1862 he obtained a temporary
appointment at Christiania University."
4563,"Even though his appointment was relatively brief,
he influenced students such as Sophus Lie (18421899)."
4564,"Sylow had a chance at a permanent
chair in 1869, but failed to obtain the appointment."
4565,"In 1872, he published a 10-page paper
presenting the theorems that now bear his name."
4566,"Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a
new edition of Abels works."
4567,"In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created
for Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie."
4568,"Sylow died in 1918.
"
4569,"15.2 Examples and Applications
Example 15.9 Using the Sylow Theorems, we can determine that A5 has subgroups of
orders 2, 3, 4, and 5."
4570,"The Sylow p-subgroups of A5 have orders 3, 4, and 5."
4571,"The Third
Sylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow p-subgroups A5 has."
4572,"Since the number of
Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 60 and also be congruent to 1 (mod 5), there are either one
or six Sylow 5-subgroups in A5."
4573,All Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate.
4574,"If there were only
a single Sylow 5-subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal
subgroup of A5."
4575,"Since A5 has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have
determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of A5.
"
4576,"
The Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups."
4577,"By
using them, we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain
hypotheses are satisfied.
"
4578,"Theorem 15.10 If p and q are distinct primes with p < q, then every group G of order
pq has a single subgroup of order q"
4579,"and this subgroup is normal in G. Hence, G cannot be
simple."
4580,"Furthermore, if q 1 (mod p), then G is cyclic.
"
4581,We know that G contains a subgroup H of order q.
4582,"The number of conjugates of
H divides pq and is equal to 1 + kq for k"
4583,"= 0, 1, . ."
4584,"However, 1 + q is already too large to
divide the order of the group; hence, H can only be conjugate to itself."
4585,"That is, H must be
normal in G.
"
4586,"The group G also has a Sylow p-subgroup, say K. The number of conjugates of K must
divide q and be equal to 1 + kp for k = 0, 1, . ."
4587,"Since q is prime, either 1 + kp = q or
1 + kp = 1."
4588,"If 1 + kp = 1, then K is normal in G."
4589,"In this case, we can easily show that G
satisfies the criteria, given in Chapter 9, for the internal direct product of H and K. Since
H is isomorphic to Zq and K is isomorphic to Zp, G = Zp "
4590,"Zq = Zpq by Theorem 9.21.
"
4591,"
Example 15.11 Every group of order 15 is cyclic."
4592,"This is true because 15 = 53 and 5 1
(mod 3).
"
4593,"
Example 15.12 Let us classify all of the groups of order 99 = 32  11 up to isomorphism.
"
4594,First we will show that every group G of order 99 is abelian.
4595,"By the Third Sylow Theorem,
there are 1 + 3k Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, for some k = 0, 1, 2, . ."
4596,"Also, 1 + 3k
must divide 11; hence, there can only be a single normal Sylow 3-subgroup H in G. Similarly,
there are 1+11k Sylow 11-subgroups and 1+11k must divide 9."
4597,"Consequently, there is only
one Sylow 11-subgroup K in G. By Corollary 14.16, any group of order p2 is abelian for p
prime; hence, H is isomorphic either to Z3 "
4598,Z3 or to Z9.
4599,"Since K has order 11, it must
be isomorphic to Z11."
4600,"Therefore, the only possible groups of order 99 are Z3  Z3 "
4601,"Z11 or
Z9  Z11 up to isomorphism.
"
4602,"
To determine all of the groups of order 5  7  47 = 1645, we need the following theorem.

"
4603,"THE SYLOW THEOREMS
185
Theorem 15.13 Let G = aba1b1 : a, b Gbe the subgroup consisting of all finite
products of elements of the form aba1b1 in a group"
4604,"G. Then G is a normal subgroup of
G and G/G is abelian.
"
4605,The subgroup G of G is called the commutator subgroup of G.
4606,"We leave the proof of
this theorem as an exercise (Exercise 10.4.14 in Chapter 10).
"
4607,Example 15.14 We will now show that every group of order 5747
4608,"= 1645 is abelian, and
cyclic by Theorem 9.21."
4609,"By the Third Sylow Theorem, G has only one subgroup H1 of order
47."
4610,So G/H1 has order 35 and must be abelian by Theorem 15.10.
4611,"Hence, the commutator
subgroup of G is contained in H which tells us that |G| is either 1 or 47."
4612,"If |G| = 1, we
are done."
4613,Suppose that |G| = 47.
4614,"The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that G has only one
subgroup of order 5 and one subgroup of order 7."
4615,"So there exist normal subgroups H2 and
H3 in G, where |H2| = 5 and |H3| = 7."
4616,"In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence,
G must be a subgroup of Hi, i = 1, 2."
4617,"Therefore, the order of G is 1, 5, or 7."
4618,"However, we
already have determined that |G| = 1 or 47."
4619,"So the commutator subgroup of G is trivial,
and consequently G is abelian.
"
4620,"
Finite Simple Groups
Given a finite group, one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups.
"
4621,Recall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups.
4622,"As in the
case of A5, proving a group to be simple can be a very diicult task; however, the Sylow
Theorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple."
4623,"Usually, some sort of
counting argument is involved.
"
4624,Example 15.15 Let us show that no group G of order 20 can be simple.
4625,"By the Third
Sylow Theorem, G contains one or more Sylow 5-subgroups."
4626,"The number of such subgroups
is congruent to 1 (mod 5) and must also divide 20."
4627,"The only possible such number is 1.
"
4628,"Since there is only a single Sylow 5-subgroup and all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate, this
subgroup must be normal.
"
4629,"
Example 15.16 Let G be a finite group of order pn, n > 1 and p prime."
4630,"By Theorem 14.15,
G has a nontrivial center."
4631,"Since the center of any group G is a normal subgroup, G cannot
be a simple group."
4632,"Therefore, groups of orders 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 49, 64, and 81 are not
simple."
4633,"In fact, the groups of order 4, 9, 25, and 49 are abelian by Corollary 14.16.
"
4634,"
Example 15.17"
4635,No group of order 56 = 23  7 is simple.
4636,"We have seen that if we can show
that there is only one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing 56, then this must be a
normal subgroup and we are done."
4637,"By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are either one or
eight Sylow 7-subgroups."
4638,"If there is only a single Sylow 7-subgroup, then it must be normal.
"
4639,"On the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow 7-subgroups."
4640,"Then each of these
subgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains
only the identity of the group."
4641,"This leaves 8  6 = 48 distinct elements in the group, each
of order 7.
"
4642,"Now let us count Sylow 2-subgroups.
"
4643,"There are either one or seven Sylow
2-subgroups."
4644,"Any element of a Sylow 2-subgroup other than the identity must have as its
order a power of 2; and therefore cannot be one of the 48 elements of order 7 in the Sylow
7-subgroups."
4645,"Since a Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, there is only enough room for a single
Sylow 2-subgroup in a group of order 56."
4646,"If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be
normal.
"
4647,"
For other groups G, it is more diicult to prove that G is not simple."
4648,"Suppose G has
order 48."
4649,"In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work.
"
4650,"We need the following lemma to prove that no group of order 48 is simple.

"
4651,"THE SYLOW THEOREMS
186
Lemma 15.18 Let H and K be finite subgroups of a group G. Then
|HK| = |H|  |K|
|H K| .
Proof."
4652,"Recall that
HK = {hk : h H, k K}.
"
4653,"Certainly, |HK| |H|  |K| since some element in HK could be written as the product of
different elements in H and K."
4654,"It is quite possible that h1k1 = h2k2 for h1, h2 H and
k1, k2 K."
4655,"If this is the case, let
a = (h1)1h2 = k1(k2)1.
"
4656,"Notice that a H K, since (h1)1h2 is in H and k2(k1)1 is in K; consequently,
h2 = h1a1
k2 = ak1.
"
4657,"Conversely, let h = h1b1 and k = bk1 for b H K."
4658,"Then hk = h1k1, where h H
and k K."
4659,"Hence, any element hk HK can be written in the form hiki for hi H and
ki K, as many times as there are elements in H K; that is, |H K| times."
4660,"Therefore,
|HK| = (|H|  |K|)/|H K|.
"
4661,"
Example 15.19 To demonstrate that a group G of order 48 is not simple, we will show
that G contains either a normal subgroup of order 8 or a normal subgroup of order 16."
4662,"By
the Third Sylow Theorem, G has either one or three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16."
4663,"If there
is only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup.
"
4664,"Suppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow 2-subgroups are H and
"
4665,We claim that |H K| = 8.
4666,"If |H K| 4, then by Lemma 15.18,
|HK| 16  16
4
= 64,
which is impossible."
4667,"Notice that H K has index two in both of H and K, so is normal in
both, and thus H and K are each in the normalizer of H K. Because H is a subgroup of
N(H K) and because N(H K) has strictly more than "
4668,"The only possibility is that
|N(H K)| = 48."
4669,"Hence, N(H K) = G.

Rings
Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms,
but we are often more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations."
4748,"For

operations of addition and multiplication."
4749,"These operations are related to one another by
the distributive property.

and multiply elements such as real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

For any nonnegative integer n and any element r in a ring R we write r +   "

16.3 Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals
In the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the
group."
4889,"Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and
multiplication in the ring."
4890,"More specifically, if R and S are rings, then a ring homomorphism
is a map  :"
4891,"R S satisfying
(a + b) = (a) + (b)
(ab) = (a)(b)
for all a,"
4892,"If  : R S is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism, then  is called an
isomorphism of rings.
"
4893,"The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to 0 plays a fundamental role in
the theory of rings."
4894,"For any ring homomorphism  : R S, we define the kernel of a ring
homomorphism to be the set
ker  = {r R : (r)"
4895,"Example 16.20 For any integer n we can define a ring homomorphism  : Z Zn by
a 7a (mod n)."
4896,"This is indeed a ring homomorphism, since
(a + b) = (a + b)
(mod n)
= a
(mod n) + b
(mod n)
= (a) + (b)
and
(ab) = ab
(mod n)
= a
(mod n)  b
(mod n)
= (a)(b).
"
4897,"The kernel of the homomorphism  is nZ.

Example 16.21 Let C[a, b] be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an interval
[a, b] as in Example 16.5.
"
4898,"For a fixed  [a, b], we can define a ring homomorphism

CHAPTER 16."
4899,"RINGS

4901,+ g) = (f + g)() = f() +
4902,g() = (f)

(fg) = (fg)() = f()g() = (f)(g).
"
4904,"Ring homomorphisms of the type  are called evaluation homomorphisms.
"
4905,"
In the next proposition we will examine some fundamental properties of ring homomor-
phisms."
4906,"The proof of the proposition is left as an exercise.
"
4907,Proposition 16.22 Let  :
4908,"R S be a ring homomorphism.

"
4911,"3. Let 1R and 1S be the identities for R and S, respectively."
4912,"If  is onto, then (1R) = 1S.
4."
4913,If R is a field and (R)
4914,"= {0}, then (R) is a field.
"
4915,In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role.
4916,"These subgroups
have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups.
"
4917,"In ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings
called ideals."
4918,"An ideal in a ring R is a subring I of R such that if a is in I and r is in R,
then both ar and ra are in I; that is, rI I and Ir I for all r R.
Example 16.23"
4919,"Every ring R has at least two ideals, {0} and R. These ideals are called
the trivial ideals.
"
4920,"
Let R be a ring with identity and suppose that I is an ideal in R such that 1 is in I.
"
4921,"Since for any r R, r1 = r I by the definition of an ideal, I = R.
Example 16.24"
4922,"If a is any element in a commutative ring R with identity, then the set
a= {ar : r R}
is an ideal in R. Certainly, ais nonempty since both 0 = a0 and a = a1 are in a. The
sum of two elements in ais ag"
4923,"The inverse of ar is
ar = a(r) a."
4924,"Finally, if we multiply an element ar aby an arbitrary element
s R, we have s(ar) = a(sr)."
4925,"Therefore, asatisfies the definition of an ideal.
"
4926,"
If R is a commutative ring with identity, then an ideal of the form a= {ar : r R}
is called a principal ideal.
"
4927,"Every ideal in the ring of integers Z is a principal ideal.
"
4928,The zero ideal {0} is a principal ideal since 0= {0}.
4929,"If I is any nonzero ideal
in Z, then I must contain some positive integer m. There exists a least positive integer n
in I by the Principle of Well-Ordering."
4930,"Now let a be any element in I. Using the division
algorithm, we know that there exist integers q and r"
4931,"such that
a = nq + r
where 0"
4932,r < n.
4933,"This equation tells us that r = a nq I, but r must be 0 since n is the
least positive element in I. Therefore, a = nq and I = n.

Example 16.26 The set nZ is ideal in the ring of integers."
4934,"If na is in nZ and b is in Z,
then nab is in nZ as required."
4935,"In fact, by Theorem 16.25, these are the only ideals of Z.

Proposition 16.27"
4936,"The kernel of any ring homomorphism  : R S is an ideal in R.

CHAPTER 16."
4937,"RINGS
197
Proof."
4938,We know from group theory that ker  is an additive subgroup of R. Suppose
4939,"that
r R and a ker ."
4940,Then we must show that ar and ra are in ker .
4941,"However,
(ar) = (a)(r) = 0(r)"
4942,"= 0
and
(ra)"
4943,"= (r)0 = 0.

Remark 16.28 In our definition of an ideal we have required that rI I and Ir I for
all r R."
4944,Such ideals are sometimes referred to as two-sided ideals.
4945,"We can also consider
one-sided ideals; that is, we may require only that either rI I or Ir I for r R hold
but not both."
4946,"Such ideals are called left ideals and right ideals, respectively."
4947,"Of course, in a
commutative ring any ideal must be two-sided."
4948,"In this text we will concentrate on two-sided

The ring R/I in Theorem 16.29 is called the factor or quotient ring.

group homomorphisms and normal subgroups, there is a relationship between ring homo-

"
4992,"A proper ideal M of a ring R is a maximal ideal
of R if the ideal M is not a proper
subset of any ideal of R except R itself."
4993,"That is, M is a maximal ideal if for any ideal I

must contain at least two elements: 0 + M = M and 1 + M."
5007,"Hence, M is a proper ideal

A proper ideal P in a commutative ring R is called a prime ideal if whenever ab P,

then either a + P = P or b + P ="
5021,"P. This means that either a is in P or b is in P, which
shows that P must be prime.

(a + P)(b + P) = ab + P = 0"
5023,"+ P = P.
Then ab P."
5024,"If a /P, then b must be in P by the definition of a prime ideal; hence,
b + P = 0 + P and R/P is an integral domain.

Example 16.39 Every ideal in Z is of the form nZ. The factor ring Z/nZ = Zn is an
integral domain only when n is prime."

5031,"Historical Note
Amalie Emmy Noether, one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century,
was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882."
5032,"She was the daughter of Max Noether (1844
1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen."
5033,"Together with Paul
Gordon (18371912), Emmy Noethers father strongly influenced her early education."
5034,"She
entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18."
5035,"Although women had been admitted
to universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to
their presence at universities in Germany.
"
5036,"Noether was one of only two women among
the universitys 986 students."
5037,"After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she
continued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.

Noether went to Gttingen to study in 1916."
5041,"David Hilbert and Felix Klein tried unsuccess-
fully to secure her an appointment at Gttingen."
5042,"Some of the faculty objected to women
lecturers, saying, What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are
expected to learn at the feet of a woman?"
5043,"Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded,
Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission
as a Privatdozent."
5044,"After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse."
5045,"At the end of World War I,
attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women."
5046,"After Noether passed her
habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her
lectures.
"
5047,"In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Gttingen."
5048,"Over the next 11 years she used
axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals."
5049,"Though she was not
good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher."
5050,"One of her many students was B. L.
van der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of
view."
5051,"Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were
Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl.
"
5052,"One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress
of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932."
5053,"In spite of all the recognition she received from her
colleagues, Noethers abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her
lifetime."
5054,"She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.
"

in Germany."

review Theorem 2.9 at this point.

Proof."
5351,We will first consider the existence of q(x) and r(x).
5352,"If f(x) is the zero polynomial,
then
0 = 0  g(x) + 0;
hence, both q and r must also be the zero polynomial."
5353,"Now suppose that f(x) is not the zero
polynomial and that deg f(x) = n and deg g(x)"
5354,"If m > n, then we can let q(x) = 0

5356,"If
f(x) = anxn + an1xn1 +    + a1x + a0

fore, r(x) = r1(x) and q(x) = q1(x).

we have eliminated the possibility that p(x) has any linear factors.

that I is a nontrivial ideal in F[x], and let p(x) I be a nonzero element of minimal degree.

Theorem 17.22 Let F be a field and suppose that p(x) F[x]."

5541,"Then p(x)is also a prime
ideal of F[x]."
5542,"Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside F[x], p(x) cannot

"
5555,"Historical Note
Throughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.
"
5556,The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c
5557,"Omar Khayyam (1048
1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions
and conic sections."
5558,"The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation ax3+bx2+cx+d = 0
was not discovered until the sixteenth century."
5559,"An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca.
14451509), wrote in Summa de Arithmetica that the solution of the cubic was impossible.
"
5560,"This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.
"
5561,"Scipione del Ferro (14651526), of the University of Bologna, solved the depressed cubic,
ax3 + cx + d"
5562,"He kept his solution an absolute secret.
"
5563,"This may seem surprising today, when mathe-
maticians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian
Renaissance secrecy was customary."
5564,"Academic appointments were not easy to secure and
depended on the ability to prevail in public contests."
5565,"Such challenges could be issued at
any time."
5566,"Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.
"
5567,"If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a
list of depressed cubics."
5568,"He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it
on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior (ca. 1506?).
"
5569,"Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher, he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo
Fontana (14991557)."
5570,Fontana was known as Tartaglia (the Stammerer).
5571,"As a youth he
had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village."
5572,"He
survived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired."
5573,"Tartaglia sent Fior
a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of
30 depressed cubics."
5574,"Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.
"
5575,"After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated
Fior, who faded into obscurity.
"
5576,"At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano (15011576), entered the story.
"
5577,"Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic."
5578,"Tartaglia
refused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter
swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else."
5579,"Using the knowledge
that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic
ax3 + bx2 + cx"
5580,"Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari (15221565), who solved the
general quartic equation,
ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0.
"
5581,"In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferros papers and discovered that he had also
solved the depressed cubic."
5582,"Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia,
so he proceeded to publish the solutions in Ars Magna (1545), in which he gave credit to
del Ferro for solving the special case of t"
5583,"This resulted in a bitter dispute between

Integral Domains
One of the most important rings we study is the ring of integers."
5702,"It was our first example of
an algebraic structure: the first polynomial ring that we examined was Z[x]."
5703,"We also know
that the integers sit naturally inside the field of rational numbers, Q."
5704,"The ring of integers
is the model for all integral domains."
5705,"In this chapter we will examine integral domains in
general, answering questions about the ideal structure of integral domains, polynomial rings
over integral domains, and whether or not an integral d"
5706,"18.1 Fields of Fractions
Every field is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are
not fields."
5707,"For example, the integers Z form an integral domain but not a field."
5708,"A question
that naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a field."
5709,"There is a
natural way to construct the rationals Q from the integers: the rationals can be represented
as formal quotients of two integers."
5710,The rational numbers are certainly a field.
5711,"In fact, it
can be shown that the rationals are the smallest field that contains the integers."
5712,"Given an
integral domain D, our question now becomes how to construct a smallest field F containing
D. We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers.
"
5713,"An element p/q Q is the quotient of two integers p and q; however, different pairs of
integers can represent the same rational number."
5714,"For instance, 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6."
5715,"We know
that
"
5716,"a
b = c
d
if and only"
5717,if ad = bc.
5718,"A more formal way of considering this problem is to examine fractions
in terms of equivalence relations."
5719,"We can think of elements in Q as ordered pairs in Z  Z.
"
5720,"A quotient p/q can be written as (p, q)."
5721,"For instance, (3, 7) would represent the fraction
3/7."
5722,"However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in Z "
5723,"There is no
fraction 5/0 corresponding to the pair (5, 0)."
5724,"Also, the pairs (3, 6) and (2, 4) both represent
the fraction 1/2."
5725,"The first problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to
be nonzero."
5726,"The second problem is solved by considering two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) to be
equivalent if ad = bc.
"
5727,"If we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral
domains in general."
5728,"Let D be any integral domain and let
S = {(a, b) : a, b D and b = 0}.
"
5729,"Define a relation on S by (a, b) (c, d) if ad = bc.
"
5730,"Lemma 18.1 The relation between elements of S is an equivalence relation.

CHAPTER 18."
5732,"INTEGRAL DOMAINS
226
Proof."
5733,"Since D is commutative, ab = ba; hence, is reflexive on D. Now suppose that
(a, b) (c, d)."
5734,Then ad = bc or cb = da.
5735,"Therefore, (c, d) (a, b) and the relation is
symmetric."
5736,"Finally, to show that the relation is transitive, let (a, b) (c, d) and (c, d) 
(e, f)."
5737,"In this case ad = bc and cf = de. Multiplying both sides of ad = bc by f yields
afd = adf = bcf = bde = bed.
"
5738,"Since D is an integral domain, we can deduce that af = be or (a, b) (e, f).
"
5739,"
We will denote the set of equivalence classes on S by FD.
"
5740,"We now need to define
the operations of addition and multiplication on FD."
5741,"Recall how fractions are added and
multiplied in Q:
a
b + c
d = ad + bc
bd
;
a
b  c
d = ac
bd.
"
5742,"It seems reasonable to define the operations of addition and multiplication on FD in a
similar manner."
5743,"If we denote the equivalence class of (a, b) S by [a, b], then we are led to
define the operations of addition and multiplication on FD by
[a, b] +"
5744,"[ad + bc, bd]
and
[a, b] "
5745,"[c, d] ="
5746,"[ac, bd],
respectively."
5747,"The next lemma demonstrates that these operations are independent of the
choice of representatives from each equivalence class.
"
5748,"Lemma 18.2 The operations of addition and multiplication on FD are well-defined.
"
5749,"We will prove that the operation of addition is well-defined.
"
5750,"The proof that
multiplication is well-defined is left as an exercise."
5751,"Let [a1, b1] ="

5753,"We must show that

5757,"[c2, d2], we know that a1b2"

5765,"The additive and multiplicative identities are [0, 1] and [1, 1], respectively."

that [0, 1] is the additive identity, observe that

5767,"[a1 + b0, b1] ="
5768,"It is easy to show that [1, 1] is the multiplicative identity."

"
5770,"Then [b, a] is also in FD and [a, b] "

5772,"[1, 1]; hence, [b, a] is the multiplicative inverse for
[a, b]."
5773,"Similarly, [a, b] is the additive inverse of [a, b]."
5774,"We leave as exercises the verification
of the associative and commutative properties of multiplication in FD."

The field FD in Lemma 18.3 is called the field of fractions or field of quotients of the
integral domain D.
Theorem 18.4 Let D be an integral domain.
"
5784,"Then D can be embedded in a field of
fractions FD, where any element in FD can be expressed as the quotient of two elements

Proof."
5786,We will first demonstrate that D can be embedded in the field FD.

(a + b) ="
5789,"[a + b, 1] ="

5791,"[b, 1] = (a) + (b)
and
(ab) ="
5792,"[ab, 1] = [a, 1][b, 1] = (a)(b);
hence,  is a homomorphism."
5793,"To show that  is one-to-one, suppose that (a) = (b).
"
5794,"Then [a, 1] ="
5795,"[b, 1], or a = a1 = 1b = b."
5796,"Finally, any element of FD can be expressed as the
quotient of two elements in D, since

5797,"[a, 1][b, 1]1 ="
5798,"[a, 1] "
5799,"[1, b] ="
5800,"[a, b].
Now let E be a field containing D and define a map  : FD"

5823,"18.2 Factorization in Integral Domains
The building blocks of the integers are the prime numbers."
5824,"If F is a field, then irreducible
polynomials in F[x] play a role that is very similar to that of the prime numbers in the
ring of integers."
5825,"Given an arbitrary integral domain, we are led to the following series of
definitions.

in R is an element that has a multiplicative inverse."

irreducible provided that whenever p = ab, either a or b is a unit."

if whenever p | ab either p | a or p | b.

coincide."

of these elements is irreducible in R; however, xy is not prime, since xy divides x2y2"

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer n > 1 can
be factored into a product of prime numbers p1    pk, where the pis are not necessarily
distinct."

5868,"An integral domain in which every ideal
is principal is called a principal ideal domain, or pid.
"
5869,"Lemma 18.11 Let D be an integral domain and let a,"
5870,"Then
1. a | b if and only if ba.
2. a and b are associates if and only if b= a.
3."
5871,"a is a unit in D if and only if a= D.
Proof.
"
5872,(1) Suppose that a | b.
5873,Then b = ax for some x D.
5874,"Hence, for every r in
D, br = (ax)r = a(xr) and ba. Conversely, suppose that ba. Then b a.
Consequently, b = ax for some x D."
5875,"Thus, a | b.
(2) Since a and b are associates, there exists a unit u such that a = ub."
5876,"Therefore, b | a
and ab. Similarly, ba. It follows that a= b. Conversely, suppose that
a= b. By part (1), a | b and b | a."
5877,"Then a = bx and b = ay for some x, y D."
5878,"Therefore,
a = bx = ayx."
5879,"Since D is an integral domain, xy = 1; that is, x and y are units and a and
b are associates.
"
5880,(3) An element a D is a unit if and only if a is an associate of 1.
5881,"However, a is an
associate of 1 if and only if a= 1= D.

Theorem 18.12 Let D be a pid and pbe a nonzero ideal in D. Then pis a maximal
ideal if and only if p is irreducible.
"
5882,"Proof.
Suppose that pis a maximal ideal.
"
5883,"If some element a in D divides p, then
pa. Since pis maximal, either D = aor p= a. Consequently, either a and p
are associates or a is a unit."
5884,"Therefore, p is irreducible.
"
5885,"Conversely, let p be irreducible."
5886,"If ais an ideal in D such that paD, then
a | p."
5887,"Since p is irreducible, either a must be a unit or a and p are associates."
5888,"Therefore,
either D = aor p= a. Thus, pis a maximal ideal.
"
5889,"
Corollary 18.13 Let D be a pid."
5890,"If p is irreducible, then p is prime.
"
5891,Let p be irreducible and suppose that p | ab.
5892,"By Corollary 16.40,
since pis a maximal ideal, pmust also be a prime ideal."
5893,"Thus, either a por b p.
Hence, either p | a or p | b.

that a= a1; otherwise, a and a1 would be associates and b1 would be a unit, which

"
6075,"Historical Note
Karl Friedrich Gauss, born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be
one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived."
6076,Gauss was truly a child prodigy.
6077,"At
the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his fathers business."
6078,"Gauss
entered college at the age of 15."
6079,"Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular
17-sided polygon with a ruler and compass."
6080,"This was the first new construction of a regular
n-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks."
6081,"Gauss succeeded in showing that if
N = 22n"
6082,"+ 1 was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular N-sided polygon.
"
6083,"Gauss obtained his Ph.D. in 1799 under the direction of Pfaff at the University of Helmstedt.
"
6084,"In his dissertation he gave the first complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
which states that every polynomial with real coeicients can be factored into linear factors
over the complex"
6085,"The acceptance of complex numbers was brought about by
Gauss, who was the first person to use the notation of i for 1.
"
6086,"Gauss then turned his attention toward number theory; in 1801, he published his famous
book on number theory, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae."
6087,"Throughout his life Gauss was in-
trigued with this branch of mathematics."
6088,"He once wrote, Mathematics is the queen of the
sciences, and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.
"
6089,"In 1807, Gauss was appointed director of the Observatory at the University of Gttingen, a
position he held until his death."
6090,"This position required him to study applications of math-
ematics to the sciences."
6091,"He succeeded in making contributions to fields such as astronomy,
mechanics, optics, geodesy, and magnetism."
6092,"Along with Wilhelm Weber, he coinvented the
first practical electric telegraph some years before a better version was invented by Samuel
F. B. Morse.
"
6093,"Gauss was clearly the most prominent mathematician in the world in the early nineteenth
century."
6094,His status naturally made his discoveries subject to intense scrutiny.
6095,"Gausss cold
and distant personality many times led him to ignore the work of his contemporaries, making
him many enemies."
6096,"He did not enjoy teaching very much, and young mathematicians who
sought him out for encouragement were often rebuffed."
6097,"Nevertheless, he had many outstand-
ing students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind."
6098,"Gauss also
offered a great deal of encouragement to Sophie Germain (17761831), who overcame the
many obstacles facing women in her day to become a very prominent mathematician."
6099,"Gauss
died at the age of 78 in Gttingen on February 23, 1855.

Lattices and Boolean Algebras
The axioms of a ring give structure to the operations of addition and multiplication on a
set."
6177,"However, we can construct algebraic structures, known as lattices and Boolean algebras,
that generalize other types of operations."
6178,"For example, the important operations on sets
are inclusion, union, and intersection."

algebraic spaces, such as set inclusion in set theory and inequality in the familiar number

Partially Ordered Sets
We begin the study of lattices and Boolean algebras by generalizing the idea of inequality.
"
6182,"Recall that a relation on a set X is a subset of X X. A relation P on X is called a partial
order of X if it satisfies the following axioms.
"
6183,"The relation is reflexive: (a, a) P for all a X.
2."
6184,"The relation is antisymmetric: if (a, b) P and (b, a) P, then a = b.
3."
6185,"The relation is transitive: if (a, b) P and (b, c) P, then (a, c) P.
We will usually write a b to mean (a, b) P unless some symbol is naturally associated
with a particular partial order, such as a b "
6186,"B. A set X together with a partial order is called a partially ordered set, or poset.
"
6187,"The set of integers (or rationals or reals) is a poset where a b has the
usual meaning for two integers a and b in Z.

Example 19.2 Let X be any set."
6188,"We will define the power set of X to be the set of all
subsets of X."
6189,We denote the power set of X by P(X).

6358,"If b is a element of B with b = O, then
there is an atom a in B such that a b.
Proof."
6359,"If b is an atom, let a = b. Otherwise, choose an element b1, not equal to O or b,
such that b1 b."
6360,We are guaranteed that this is possible since b is not an atom.
6361,"If b1 is an
atom, then we are done."
6362,"If not, choose b2, not equal to O or b1, such that b2 b1."
6363,"Again,
if b2 is an atom, let a = b2."
6364,"Continuing this process, we can obtain a chain
O   "
6365,"b3 b2 b1 b.
"
6366,"Since B is a finite Boolean algebra, this chain must be finite."
6367,"That is, for some k, bk is an
atom."
6368,"Let a = bk.
"
6369,"
Lemma 19.19 Let a and b be atoms in a finite Boolean algebra B such that a = b."
6370,"Then
a b = O.
Proof."
6371,"Since a b is the greatest lower bound of a and b, we know that a b a."
6372,"Hence,
either a b = a or a b = O. However, if a b = a, then either a b or a = O."
6373,"In either
case we have a contradiction because a and b are both atoms; therefore, a b = O.

Lemma 19.20 Let B be a Boolean algebra and a,"

equivalent.

Proof."
6379,"If a b, then a b = b."

a b = a (a b)

6382,"If a b = I, then
a = a (a b)
= (a a) (a b)

= a b.
"
6383,"Thus, a b.
"
6384,"
Lemma 19.21 Let B be a Boolean algebra and b and c be elements in B such that b c.
"
6385,"Then there exists an atom a B such that a b and a c.
Proof."
6386,"By Lemma 19.20, b c = O. Hence, there exists an atom a such that a b c.
Consequently, a b and a c.

b = a a1    an, then a = ai for some i = 1, . . ."
6391,", n.
Proof."
6392,Let b1 = a1    an.
6393,"Since ai b for each i, we know that b1 b."
6394,"If we can show
that b b1, then the lemma is true by antisymmetry."
6395,Assume b b1.
6396,"Then there exists
an atom a such that a b and a b1."
6397,"Since a is an atom and a b, we can deduce that
a = ai for some ai."
6398,"However, this is impossible since a b1."
6399,"Therefore, b b1.
"
6400,Now suppose that b = a1    an.
6401,"If a is an atom less than b,
a = a b = a (a1    an) = (a a1)   "
6402,But each term is O or a with a ai occurring for only one ai.
6403,"Hence, by Lemma 19.19,
a = ai for some i.

Theorem 19.23 Let B be a finite Boolean algebra."
6404,"Then there exists a set X such that B
is isomorphic to P(X).
"

Consequently, we can define a map  : B P(X) by

The usefulness of Boolean algebras has become increasingly apparent over the pas"
6422,"The circuit design of computer
chips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras."
6423,"In this section we will develop the
Boolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches; however, these results can easily be
generalized to the design of integrated computer circuitry.
"
6424,"A switch is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the flow
of current through the circuit."
6425,"Each switch has two possible states: it can be open, and
not allow the passage of current through the circuit, or a it can be closed, and allow the
passage of current."
6426,These states are mutually exclusive.
6427,"We require that every switch be
in one state or the othera switch cannot be open and closed at the same time."
6428,"Also, if
one switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter;
that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter a will always be open at
the same t"
6429,"Given two switches, we can construct two fundamental types of circuits."
6430,"Two switches
a and b are in series if they make up a circuit of the type that is illustrated in Figure 19.25.
"
6431,"Current can pass between the terminals A and B in a series circuit only if both of the
switches a and b are closed."
6432,We will denote this combination of switches by a b.
6433,"Two
switches a and b are in parallel if they form a circuit of the type that appears in Figure 19.26.
"
6434,"In the case of a parallel circuit, current can pass between A and B if either one of the switches
is closed."
6435,"We denote a parallel combination of circuits a and b by a b.

"
6437,"We can build more complicated electrical circuits out of series and parallel circuits by
replacing any switch in the circuit with one of these two fundamental types of circuits.
"
6438,"Circuits constructed in this manner are called series-parallel circuits.
"
6439,We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same.
6440,"That is, if we set the
switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result."
6441,"For example,

in a series circuit ab is exactly the same as ba."
6443,"Notice that this is exactly the commutative
law for Boolean algebras."
6444,"In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra
under the operations of and"
6445,"We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of
a Boolean algebra."
6446,"The distributive law, a (b c) = (a b) (a c), is illustrated in
Figure 19.27."
6447,"If a is a switch, then a is the switch that is always open when a is closed and
always closed when a is open."
6448,"A circuit that is always closed is I in our algebra; a circuit
that is always open is O."

"
6454,"We leave as an exercise the proof of this theorem for the Boolean algebra axioms not
yet verified."
6455,"We can now apply the techniques of Boolean algebras to switching theory.

algebra to reduce it to a simpler one."

we can replace the more complicated circuit with a circuit containing the single switch a

"
6461,"Sage has a full suite of functionality for both posets and lattices, all as part of its ex-
cellent support for combinatorics."
6462,"There is little in this chapter that cannot be investigated
with Sage.
"
6463,"Historical Note
George Boole (18151864) was the first person to study lattices."
6464,"In 1847, he published The
Investigation of the Laws of Thought, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic
and the calculus of propositions."
6465,"Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form
rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating
as with how he was calculating it."
6466,"Booles work was carried on by his friend Augustus De
Morgan (18061871)."
6467,"De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set
theory, as is illustrated by De Morgans laws for set theory."
6468,"He believed, as did Boole, that
mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.
"
6469,"Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North White-
head (18611947), Bertrand Russell (18721970), and David Hilbert (18621943)."
6470,"In Prin-
cipia Mathematica, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between math-
ematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal
logic."
6471,"If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much
of the rest of existing mathematics."
6472,"Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using
symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics."
6473,"His approach
was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gdel (19061978), who proved that there will always
be undecidable problems in any suiciently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any

6474,"As often occurs, this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a
wide variety of applications."
6475,"Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design
of the large-scale integrated circuitry found on todays computer chips."

used lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies; biologists have used them to
describe biosystems.

Vector Spaces
In a physical system a quantity can often be described with a single number."
6549,"For example,
we need to know only a single number to describe temperature, mass, or volume."
6550,"However,
for some quantities, such as location, we need several numbers."
6551,"To give the location of
a point in space, we need x, y, and z coordinates."
6552,"Temperature distribution over a solid
object requires four numbers: three to identify each point within the object and a fourth
to describe the temperature at that point."
6553,"Often n-tuples of numbers, or vectors, also have
certain algebraic properties, such as addition or scalar multiplication.
"
6554,In this chapter we will examine mathematical structures called vector spaces.
6555,"As with
groups and rings, it is desirable to give a simple list of axioms that must be satisfied to
make a set of vectors a structure worth studying.
"
6556,"20.1 Definitions and Examples
A vector space V over a field F is an abelian group with a scalar product v or v defined
for all  F and all v V satisfying the following axioms.

 ( + )v = v + v;
 (u + v) = u + v;

The following proposition is a consequence of the fact that any system of homogeneous
linear equations with more unknowns than equations will have a nontrivial solution."
6662,"We
leave the details of the proof for the end-of-chapter exercises.
"
6663,Proposition 20.11 Suppose that a vector space V is spanned by n vectors.

any set of m vectors in V must be linearly dependent.
"
6665,"A set {e1, e2, . . ."
6666,", en} of vectors in a vector space V is called a basis for V if {e1, e2, . . ."
6667,", en}
is a linearly independent set that spans V .
"
6668,"Example 20.12 The vectors e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0), and e3 = (0, 0, 1) form a basis
for R3."
6669,"The set certainly spans R3, since any arbitrary vector (x1, x2, x3) in R3 can be
written as x1e1"
6670,"Also, none of the vectors e1, e2, e3 can be written as a linear
combination of the other two; hence, they are linearly independent."
6671,"The vectors e1, e2, e3
are not the only basis of R3: the set {(3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 0), (1, 1, 1)} is also a basis for R3.

2 : a, b Q}."
6673,"The sets {1,

2 } and {1+

is no unique basis for a vector space."

2 ) consists of exactly two vectors."
6679,"This is a consequence of
the next proposition.

6680,"Proposition 20.14 Let {e1, e2, . . ."
6681,", em} and {f1, f2, . ."
6682,", fn} be two bases for a vector space
V ."
6683,"Then m = n.
Proof.
"
6684,"Since {e1, e2, . . ."

"
6686,"By Proposi-
tion 20.11, n m."
6687,"Similarly, {f1, f2, . ."
6688,", fn} is a linearly independent set, and the last

6689,"Consequently, m = n.

Fields
"
6809,It is natural to ask whether or not some field F is contained in a larger field.
6810,"We think of
the rational numbers, which reside inside the real numbers, while in turn, the real numbers
live inside the complex numbers."
6811,"We can also study the fields between Q and R and inquire
as to the nature of these fields.
"
6812,"More specifically if we are given a field F and a polynomial p(x) F[x], we can ask
whether or not we can find a field E containing F such that p(x) factors into linear factors
over E[x]."
6813,"For example, if we consider the polynomial
p(x) = x4 5x2 + 6
in Q[x], then p(x) factors as (x2 2)(x2 3)."
6814,"However, both of these factors are irreducible
in Q[x]."
6815,"If we wish to find a zero of p(x), we must go to a larger field."
6816,"Certainly the field
of real numbers will work, since
p(x)"

"

Q(

2) = {a + b

2 : a, b Q}.
"
6819,"We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field
F.
"
6820,"Extension Fields
A field E is an extension field of a field F if F is a subfield of E. The field F is called the
base field."
6821,"We write F E.

F = Q(

7143,"21.3 Geometric Constructions
"
7144,"In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed."
7145,"These problems are geometric in
nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school
geometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve"
7146,"The problems can be stated as follows.
"
7147,"Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using
only a straightedge and compass?
2."
7148,"Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a
straightedge and compass?
3."
7149,"Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of
the original?"
7150,"Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the
construction.
"
7151,"After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was
finally shown to be impossible."
7152,"We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the
solutions do not exist."
7153,"It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these
three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.
"
7154,"First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,
and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.
"
7155,"To begin with, a
straightedge is not a ruler."
7156,We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
7157,"It is
merely a tool for drawing a line through two points."
7158,"The statement that the trisection of
an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to
trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction."
7159,"Certainly it is possible to trisect an
angle in special cases."

7162,"However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a 20angle."
7163,"Therefore, we
cannot trisect a 60angle.
"
7164,"Constructible Numbers
A real number  is constructible if we can construct a line segment of length || in a finite
number of steps from a segment of unit length by using a straightedge and compass.

The first case gives no new points in R, since the solution of two equations of the form

to the second case."

"
7243,"Historical Note
Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory.
"

can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = z2; Fermat conjectured
that the equation xn"

7247,"He stated in the
margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus Arithmetica that he had found a
marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain
it"
7248,"Building on work of other mathematicians, it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded
in proving Fermats Last Theorem in the 1990s."
7249,"Wiless achievement was reported on the
front page of the New York Times.

"
7250,"FIELDS
275
Attempts to prove Fermats Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic
number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler (17071783)."
7251,"Significant
advances in the understanding of Fermats Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer
(18101893)."
7252,"Kummers student, Leopold Kronecker (18231891), became one of the leading
algebraists of the nineteenth century."
7253,"Kroneckers theory of ideals and his study of algebraic
number theory added much to the understanding of fields.
"
7254,"David Hilbert (18621943) and Hermann Minkowski (18641909) were among the mathe-
maticians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century."
7255,"Hilbert
and Minkowski were both mathematicians at Gttingen University in Germany."
7256,"Gttingen
was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two cen-
turies."
7257,"The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss,
Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether, and Weyl.
"
7258,"Andr Weil answered questions in number theory using algebraic geometry, a field of math-
ematics that studies geometry by studying commutative rings."

dent of Grothendieck, solved several of Weils number-theoretic conjectures."
7261,"One of the
most recent contributions to algebra and number theory is Gerd Faltings proof of the

Finite Fields
Finite fields appear in many applications of algebra, including coding theory and cryptog-
raphy."
7331,"We already know one finite field, Zp, where p is prime."
7332,"In this chapter we will show
that a unique finite field of order pn exists for every prime p, where n is a positive integer.
"
7333,"Finite fields are also called Galois fields in honor of variste Galois, who was one of the first
mathematicians to investigate them.
"
7334,"22.1 Structure of a Finite Field
Recall that a field F has characteristic p if p is the smallest positive integer such that for
every nonzero element  in F, we have p = 0.
"
7335,"If no such integer exists, then F has
characteristic 0."
7336,From Theorem 16.19 we know that p must be prime.
7337,"Suppose that F is a
finite field with n elements."
7338,"Then n = 0 for all  in F. Consequently, the characteristic of
F must be p, where p is a prime dividing n."
7339,"This discussion is summarized in the following
proposition.
"
7340,"If F is a finite field, then the characteristic of F is p, where p is prime.
"
7341,"Throughout this chapter we will assume that p is a prime number unless otherwise
stated.
"
7342,"If F is a finite field of characteristic p, then the order of F is pn for
some n N.
Proof."
7343,Let  : Z F be the ring homomorphism defined by (n) =
7344,"Since the
characteristic of F is p, the kernel of  must be pZ and the image of  must be a subfield
of F isomorphic to Zp."
7345,"We will denote this subfield by K. Since F is a finite field, it
must be a finite extension of K and, therefore, an algebraic extension of K. Suppose that
[F : K] = n is the dimension of F, where F is"

1, . . ."
7347,", n F such that any element  in F can be written uniquely in the form

Since there are p elements in K, there are pn possible linear
combinations of the is."
7348,"Therefore, the order of F must be pn.

7352,We will prove this lemma using mathematical induction on n.

the 5-tuple (10011) is

n-tuple."

7491,"+ a2x2 must be the
zero polynomial."
7492,"Therefore, ker  = {(000)} and  is one-to-one.
"

mials 1, x, and x2 are encoded:
(1 + x3) "
7494,"1 = 1 + x3

(1 + x3)x2 = x2 + x5.

C = g(t)= {f(t)g(t) : f(t) Rn and g(x) | (xn 1) in Z2[x]}.

Historical Note
Solutions for "
8012,"Attempts to
find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of historys best mathematicians."
8013,"In
1798, P. Ruini submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found; however,
the paper was not well received."
8014,"In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel (18021829) finally offered the
first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.
"
8015,Abel inspired the work of variste Galois.
8016,"Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraor-
dinary mathematical talent at the age of 14."

technique several times; however, he had great diiculty meeting the formal entrance re-

quirements, and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius."
8019,"He was finally
accepted at the cole Normale in 1829.
"
8020,Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials.
8021,"In 1829, at the age of
17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Acadmie des
Sciences de Paris."
8022,"These papers were sent to Cauchy, who subsequently lost them."
8023,"A third
paper was submitted to Fourier, who died before he could read the paper."
8024,"Another paper
was presented, but was not published until 1846.
"
8025,Galois democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830.
8026,"He was expelled from
school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil."
8027,"After his release in 1832, he was drawn
into a duel possibly over a love affair."
8028,"Certain that he would be killed, he spent the evening
before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his
friend Chevalier."
8029,"He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.

8030,"The immediate goal of this section
is to determine when the roots of a polynomial f(x) can be computed with a finite number of
operations on the coeicients of f(x)."

us whether or not a polynomial f(x) is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra."
8148,This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis.
8149,"Prior
to Gausss proof, mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real
and complex numbers having no solutions."
8150,"The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states
that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.
"
8151,Theorem 23.34 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
8152,"The field of complex numbers is
algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in C[x] has a root in C.
Proof."
8153,Suppose that E is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers.
8154,"Since
any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an
 E such that"
8155,E = C() with  the root of an irreducible polynomial f(x) in C[x].
8156,"The
splitting field L of f(x) is a finite normal separable extension of C that contains E. We
must show that it is impossible for L to be a proper extension of C.
Suppose that L is a proper extension "
8157,"= (x2+1)
over R, L is a finite normal separable extension of R. Let K be the fixed field of a Sylow
2-subgroup G of G(L/R)."
8158,Then L K R and |G(L/K)| =
8159,[L : K].
8160,Since [L : R] =
8161,"[L :
K][K : R], we know that [K : R] must be odd."
8162,"Consequently, K = R() with  having a
minimal polynomial f(x) of odd degree."
8163,"Therefore, K = R.
We now know that G(L/R) must be a 2-group."
8164,It follows that G(L/C) is a 2-group.
8165,"We
have assumed that L = C; therefore, |G(L/C)| 2."
8166,"By the first Sylow Theorem and the
Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup G of G(L/C) of index 2
and a field E fixed elementwise by G."
8167,"Then [E : C] = 2 and there exists an element  E
with minimal polynomial x2 + bx + c in C[x]."
8168,"This polynomial has roots (b 

b2 4c )/2
"
8169,"that are in C, since b2 4c is in C."
8170,"This is impossible; hence, L = C.

Although our proof was strictly algebraic, we were forced to rely on results from cal-
culus."
8171,"It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every
polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square
root."
8172,"It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this diiculty and formulate a purely
algebraic argument."
8173,"It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the

Preface
"

for first- or second-year undergraduate math and computer science majors, especially
those who intend to teach "
8812,"The book began
as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern
Colorado."
8813,"This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as
the bridge course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate introduction
to proofs course."
8814,"As this course has evolved to support our computer science
major, so has the text."
8815,"The current version of the book is intended to support
inquiry-based teaching for understanding that is so crucial for future teachers,
while also providing the necessary mathematical foundation and a"

2024 using an early version of this edition, I was pleasantly surprised by how many
students reported that they, for the first time, saw how useful math could be in"
8817,"I hope that this experience can be replicated in other classes using this
text.
"
8818,"This book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem-oriented or
inquiry-based methods."
8819,"Each section begins with a preview of the content that
includes an open-ended Investigate!"
8820,"motivating question, as well as a structured
preview activity."
8821,"The preview activities are carefully scaffolded to provide an
entry-point to the sections topic and to prime students to engage deeply in the
material."
8822,"Depending on the pace of the class, I have found success assigning only
the section preview before class, using the preview activity as in-class group work,
or assigning the entire section to be read "
8823,"For those readers using this book for self-study, the organization of the
sections will hopefully mimic the style of a rich inquiry-based classroom.
"
8824,"The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I
teach at UNC."
8825,"The main areas of study are logic and proof, graph theory, combina-
torics, and sequences."
8826,"Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences.
"
8827,"Discrete structures are introduced as needed, but a more thorough treatment of
sets and functions is included as a separate chapter, which can be studied indepen-
dent of the other content."
8828,"The final chapter covers two additional topics: generating
functions and number theory.
"
8829,"While I believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free
to skip around to what interests you."
8830,"There are occasionally examples and exercises
that rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum, and they
usually can either be skipped or understood without too much addition"

you are an instructor, you can also create a custom version by editing the PreTeXt

Improvements to the 4th Edition.
"
8833,"Many of the sections have been rewritten to
improve the clarity of the exposition.
"
8834," Nearly 300 new exercises, bringing the total to more than 750."
8835,"These are better
divided into preview activity questions, reading questions, practice problems,
and additional exercises."
8836,"Most of the new exercises are interactive for the
online version.
"
8837," New sections on probability, relations, and discrete structures and their proofs.
"
8838,"Some other sections have been split up to make it more likely that a single
class period can be devoted to a single topic.
"
8839," Improved presentation for the counting chapter with a focus on considering
sets of outcomes more than following rules.
"
8840,"activities of the 3rd Edition have been split into two types:
Investigate!"
8841,questions and Preview Activities.
8842,"The former are open-ended
questions designed to engage you with the topic soon to be discussed."
8843,"The
latter are structured preview activities that you should be able to completely
answer before reading the section.
"
8844,"The previous editions (3rd Edition, released in 2019, 2nd Edition, released in
2016, and the Fall 2015 Edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use
those versions due to familiarit"
8845,I plan to continue improving the book.
8846,"Some of this will happen in real-time
by updating the online versions to include new content (numbering will remain
consistent)."

you have them.

How to Use This Book
In addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage
you to interact with the mathematics.
"
8849,"Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very
beginning of a topic) you will find open-ended questions designed to engage you
with the topic soon to be discussed."
8850,"You really should spend some time thinking
about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section."
8851,"However,
dont worry if you cannot find a satisfying solution right away."
8852,"The goal is to pique
your interest, so you will read what is next looking for answers.
"
8853,Most sections include a structured preview activity.
8854,"These
contain leading questions that you should be able to completely answer before
reading the section."
8855,"The idea is that the questions prime you to engage meaningfully
with the new content ahead."
8856,"If you are using the online version, most of these
questions will provide you with immediate feedback so you can be confident moving
forward.
"
8857,I have tried to include the correct number of examples.
8858,"For those
examples that include problems, full solutions are included."
8859,"Before reading the
solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking."
8860,"Unlike
some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all-inclusive for problems you
will see in the exercises."
8861,"They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other
problems."
8862,"Instead, use the examples to deepen your understanding of the concepts
and techniques discussed in each section."
8863,"Then use this understanding to solve the
exercises at the end of each section.
Exercises.
"
8864,You get good at math through practice.
8865,"Each section concludes with
practice problems meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that
section; the online version provides immediate feedback on these problems."
8866,"There
are then additional exercises that are more challenging and open-ended."
8867,"These
might be assigned as written homework or used in class as group work."
8868,"Some of the
additional exercises have hints or solutions in the back of the book, but use these
as little as possible."
8869,Struggle is good for you.
8870,"At the end of each chapter, a larger
collection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of chapter review) which might
bridge the material of different sections in that chapter.
"
8871,"Interactive Online Version.
"
8872,"For those of you reading this in print or as a PDF, I
encourage you to also check out the interactive online version."
8873,"Many of the preview
activities and exercises are interactive and can give you immediate feedback."
8874,"Some of
xi

xii
these have randomized components, allowing you to practice many similar versions
of the same problems until you master the topic.
"
8875,"Hints and solutions to examples are also hidden away behind an extra click to
encourage you to think about the problem before reading the solution."
8876,"There is a
good search feature available as well, and the index has expandable links to see the
content without jumping to the page immediately."
8877,"There is also a python scratch
pad (the pencil icon) so you can try out some code if you feel so inclined.
"
8878,Additional interactivity is planned.
8879,"These bonus features will be added on a
rolling basis, so keep an eye out!

Introduction and Preliminaries
Welcome to Discrete Mathematics."
9121,"If this is your first time encountering the subject,
you will probably find discrete mathematics quite different from other math subjects.
"
9122,You might not even know what discrete math is!
9123,"Hopefully this short introduction
will shed some light on what the subject is about and what you can expect as you
move forward in your studies.
"
9124,"0.1
What is Discrete Mathematics?
discrete / diskrt.
"
9125,"Adjective: Individually separate and distinct.
"
9126,"Synonyms: separate - detached - distinct - abstract.
"
9127,Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard.
9128,"What is
mathematics?"
9129,The study of numbers?
9130,"In part yes, but you also study functions and
lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . . . ."
9131,"Or perhaps you want
to say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems.
"
9132,What sort of problems?
9133,"Well, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles,
. . . ."
9134,"Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of
discrete to it, as defined above."
9135,"Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is
individually separate and distinct.
"
9136,"In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers
(perhaps they constitute the range of a function)."
9137,"You would represent this set as an
interval: [0, ) is the range of () = 2 since the set of outputs of the function are
all real numbers 0 and greater."
9138,This set of numbers is NOT discrete.
9139,"The numbers in
the set are not separated by much at all."
9140,"In fact, take any two numbers in the set and
there are infinitely many more between them that are also in the set.
"
9141,"Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would
not be an interval."
9142,"Consider the function that gives the number of children of
each person reading this."
9143,What is the range?
9144,"Im guessing it is something like
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}."
9145,Maybe 5 or 6 is in there too.1
9146,"But certainly nobody reading this has
1.32419 children."
9147,This output set is discrete because the elements are separate.
9148,"The
inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual
person.
"
9149,"There are many discrete mathematical objects besides sets of numbers; we will
introduce some of these in Section 0.2."
9150,"Studying these discrete structures is the main

focus of discrete mathematics and this book."
9153,"However, the reason we want to study
these structures is because they provide a way to model real-world problems.2
To get a feel for the subject, lets consider the types of problems you solve in
discr"
9154,"Here are a few simple examples:

9157,"Answer
the questions in these as best you can to give yourself a feel for what is coming next.
"
9158,"The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for
all of his friends."
9159,"To kick things off, they decide that everyone should
shake hands."
9160,"Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands
with every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once,
how many handshakes take place?
"
9161,"At the warm-up event for Oscars All-Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al
ate one hot dog."
9162,"Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs.
"
9163,"Not to be outdone, Carl ate five."
9164,"This continued with each contestant
eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant."
9165,"How many
hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat?"
9166,"How many hot
dogs were eaten in total?
3."
9167,"After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber.
"
9168,The room is empty except for two large chests.
9169,"On each is carved a
message (strangely in English):
Exactly one of these
chests contains a treasure,
while the other is filled with
deadly immortal scorpions.
"
9170,"For either chest, if the
chests message is true, then
the chest contains treasure.
"
9171,"The problem is, you dont know whether the messages are true or
false."
9172,"What do you do?
"
9173,"Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to
build roads directly connecting each pair of towns."
9174,"While the towns
had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they
wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each
other (as stop signs had not yet been invented)."
9175,"Also, tunnels and
bridges were not allowed, for moral reasons."
9176,"Is it possible for each of
these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without
creating any intersections?
2Many of the problems discussed in this book are admittedly contrived and cle"

As you consider the problems above, dont worry if it is not obvious to you
what the solutions are."
9178,"We are more interested here in what sort of information we
need to be able to answer the questions."
9179,"How can we represent the situation using
individually separate and distinct objects?"
9180,"Dont read on until you have thought
about at least this for each of the questions.
"
9181,"Here are some things you might have thought about:
1."
9182,The people at the party are individuals.
9183,We can consider the set of people.
9184,"We
can also consider sets of pairs of people, since it takes exactly two people to
shake hands."
9185,"So the question is really, how many pairs can you make using
elements from a 10-element set?
"
9186,"For example, if there were three people at the party, conveniently named 1, 2,
and 3, then the pairs would be (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3)."
9187,"Or should we include
(2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2) as well?
2."
9188,"To count the number of hot dogs eaten, either by an individual or in total,
we could use a sequence of integers (whole numbers)."
9189,"The th term in the
sequence might represent the number of hot dogs eaten by the th contestant.
"
9190,"We can consider a second sequence, also of integers, that gives the total number
of hot dogs eaten by the first contestants combined.
"
9191,"The solution to the problem will then be the value of the 26th term in the
sequence."
9192,"To help us find this, we could consider the rate of growth of the
sequences, as well as how these two sequences relate to each other.
"
9193,"3. Logic questions also belong under the discrete math umbrella: Each statement
can have a value of True or False (and there is nothing in-between)."
9194,"To answer
questions like that of the chests of scorpions, we must understand the structure
of the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements
interact to determine the truth va"
9195,"The last question is about a discrete structure called a graph, not to be confused
with a graph of a function or set of points."
9196,"We can use a graph to represent
which elements of a set (or towns) are related to each other (or connected by
a road)."
9197,"In this case, the question becomes, can we draw a graph with five
vertices (towns) and ten edges (roads) such that no two edges intersect?
"
9198,"The four problems above illustrate the four main topics of this book: combina-
torics (the theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways),
sequences, symbolic logic, and graph "
9199,"However, there are other topics
that are also considered part of discrete mathematics, including computer science,
abstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of
thes"
9200,Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do it.
9201,"Lets get
started!"
9202,"Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we
will consider a very brief overview of the types of discrete structures we will be
using.

Reading Questions
Each section of the book will end with a small number of Reading Questions like
the ones below."
9204,These are designed to help you reflect on what you have read.
9205,"In
particular, the final reading question asks you to ask a question of your own."
9206,"Thinking
about what you dont yet know is a wonderful way to further your understanding of
what you do.
"
9207,"Right now, how would you describe what discrete mathematics is about, if
you were telling your friends about the class you are in?"
9208,"Write one or two
sentences.

from 0 to 6."
9213,How many tiles are in a double-six domino set?

9217,"Then write 2-3
sentences describing your thoughts."
9218,"You do not need to find a complete
solution, but you should describe what you could try and what you think you
might need to do to find a solution.
"
9219,"We are taking a problem-solving approach to discrete mathematics: We will
consider a large variety of questions that have a discrete feel to them, and consider
how to answer those questions (and prove"
9220,"This is not
the only way to study discrete math."
9221,"Another approach would be to study the tools
used to solve the problems."
9222,"If we were art students, we could study paintbrushes
and easels and the composition of paint, which would be interesting for sure, but I
think it is more enjoyable to actually paint those happy little"
9223,"That said, understanding your tools does help you use them, so in this section,
we will consider some basic tools used in discrete mathematics."
9224,"We will come back
to these throughout our studies and understand them better as we need to.
"
9225,The tools in our subject are called discrete structures.
9226,"They are the mathematical
objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving."
9227,"Structure
is a good word here, since these things have fairly rigid constraints that make
them what they are, just like an apartment building is going to have different
characteristics than an airplan"
9228,"The structures we will use most in discrete math are sets, functions, sequences,
relations, and graphs."
9229,We now briefly preview each of these.
9230,"As we progress
through our studies, each will be explored in more detail.
"
9231,"0.2.2
Sets
A set is an unordered collection of elements."
9232,"This is fairly vague, but unless we
want to spend a whole book trying to understand sets more precisely, it will be
good enough for us."
9233,"It is possible to define all of mathematics using just sets (even
5

0."
9234,"Introduction and Preliminaries
numbers can be thought of as sets themselves), but this is also not what we will do.
"
9235,"Rather, we want to be able to talk about collections of numbers and other objects,
and we will collect them in something we call a set.
"
9236,We can describe sets by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.
9237,"We
could specify this membership in words (e.g., Let be the set of all natural numbers
less than 10), or by explicitly listing all the elements (e.g., = {3, 5, 7}), or using
something called set compr"
9238,"An example
of this is = {: < 10}."
9239,"We would read that as is the set of natural
numbers that satisfy the property that they are less than 10."
9240,"More precisely, the 
symbol represents the natural numbers, which is itself a set: = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}"
9241,"(this
shows another way to describe a set)."
9242,The symbol means is an element of.
9243,"The :
is read such that and tells us that what comes next is the condition that must be
true of the sets elements.
"
9244,By the way...
9245,"In this book, we define the natural numbers to be the whole
numbers starting with 0."
9246,Not every book includes 0 in this set.
9247,"It largely
depends on what area of mathematics you study.
"
9248,"Since there are multiple ways to describe the same set, we should be careful
about what it means for sets to be the same or different."
9249,"A set is determined by its
membership, so all four of the following describe exactly the same set:
1."
9250,"{1, 2, 3, 4}.
"
9251,"2. {1, 2, 1 + 1, 1 + 2, 2 + 2}."
9252,(How many numbers belong to this set?
9253,"Its not 5.)
"
9254,"3. {2, 4, 1, 3}."
9255,"(All that matters is what elements are in the collection, not what
order they were written down in.)
"
9256,"4. {: < 5 and 1}.
"
9257,"There are lots of things you can do with sets, which we will consider in more
detail as we need to."
9258,"We will see that it is often helpful to build new sets from
ones we already have (by taking the union or intersection of sets, for example), to
compare sets (asking if one set is a subset of another),"
9259,"We might also want to match up elements
of one set with another: To do this, we might use a function, which we will discuss
next."
9260,"Awesomely, we can also use sets themselves to describe functions."
9261,"Lets check
it out.
"
9262,"One way to define a function is as a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.
"
9263,The output is called the image of the input.
9264,"Functions also come equipped with a
domain, the set of all inputs, and a codomain, the set of all allowable outputs."
9265,"You
might also speak of the range of the function, which is the set of all actual outputs,
or put another way, the set of all images of elements from the domain.

"
9266,"Discrete Structures
7
We write : to describe a function with name , domain and codomain
."
9267,This does not tell us which function is though.
9268,"To define the function, we must
describe the rule."
9269,"Often this is done with a formula (for example, () = 2 says
that each element of the domain is mapped to its square), or in words (like how we
just described the squaring function)."
9270,"We could also define a function with a table
or a graph.
"
9271,"The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for
each input."
9272,"That is, the rule must be a good rule."
9273,"What output do we assign to the
input 7?"
9274,"There can only be one answer for any particular function.
"
9275,"Since a function maps one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain), there
is an obvious connection between sets and functions."
9276,"There is another connection
worth considering though: The graph of a function is often described as a set of
points."
9277,"Here is an example.
"
9278,"Example 0.2.2
Consider the function : {1, 2, 3} {2, 4, 6} defined by () ="
9279,"If we
wanted to plot a graph of this function, we would draw the points (1, 2), (2, 4),
and (3, 6) (but we would not connect these points with lines, since we are
studying discrete math; the domain on"
9280,"So associated with the function is the set of points {(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)}."
9281,"In
fact, this set of points is associated exactly with this (and only this) function.
"
9282,"So we can think of this set of points as the function itself.
"
9283,"Of course, we are using a mathematical object here: an ordered pair."
9284,"This is not
a set (since sets are unordered)."
9285,How should we talk about ordered things?
9286,"We will
take this question up in the next section.
"
9287,"There is one more important consideration about how we define a function with
a rule."
9288,"A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule
based solely on its input."
9289,This is what most of us think of as a formula.
9290,"For example,
() = 3+ 1 is a closed formula, since to find (5) (say) we take the input 5 and do
something to it:"
9291,"Multiply it by 5 and then add 1.
"
9292,What else could a formula possibly be?
9293,"A recursive definition of a function tells
us how to compute the output for a given input based on other outputs of the function.
"
9294,"For example, we might insist that () = 2  (1)."
9295,"If we also specify an initial
condition that (0) = 3, then we can find (1) = 2  3 = 6, and then (2) = 2  6 = 12,
and so on."
9296,What is (5) here?
9297,"The only way to answer that is to find (4), which
means we need to find (3), which we could do, since we have computed (2).
"
9298,"Recursive definitions of functions might be less useful for finding a particular
output, but they are often easier to specify for a particular application."
9299,"We will
explore this phenomenon more when we study sequences."

Sequences
Sometimes we are interested not just in a collection of numbers, but in what order
those numbers appear."
9302,"In such cases, we cannot use sets, since they do not distinguish
between the order of their elements."
9303,"Instead, we consider sequences.
"
9304,We will consider both finite and infinite sequences.
9305,"A finite sequence may be
something as simple as (1, 2, 3); that is a sequence with 3 elements, in that particular
order."
9306,"We might also call this an ordered triple, the same way that (7, 3) is an
ordered pair."
9307,"In general, we could call this an -tuple if it has elements (we assume
that tuples are ordered).
"
9308,"The key difference between the sequence (1, 2, 3) and the set {1, 2, 3} is that we
care about the order."
9309,"That is, the sequence (1, 2, 3) is different from the sequence
(2, 3, 1), while the set {1, 2, 3} is identical to {2, 3, 1}.
"
9310,We will often use sequences as a counting tool.
9311,"For example, a very simple
counting question is, How many wheels do 100 cars have?"
9312,"Instead of answering
just this one question, we could generalize and ask how many wheels cars have,
and get a sequence of answers."
9313,"This yields the infinite sequence (4, 8, 12, . . .)."
9314,"The
order these multiples of 4 appear in is important, since each number in the sequence
corresponds to a specific version of the question.
"
9315,It is fine to think of a sequence of numbers as an ordered list.
9316,"We can refer to the
terms simply as
0, 1, 2, . . .
and might refer to the entire sequence as ()0 or ().
If we want to be a little more precise and more abstract, we can think of a sequence
as a functi"
9317,"The domain is the natural numbers or some subset of consecutive
natural numbers (like {1, 2, 3, 4})."
9318,The codomain is some set.
9319,"We think of the domain
as the positions in the sequence, and the image of those inputs as the terms in the
sequence.
"
9320,"For example, we might consider the Fibonacci sequence ( )1, which starts
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . ."
9321,What is the 4th term in the sequence?
9322,"We might say 4 = 3 (this is
assuming the first 1 is the first term and not the 0th term)."
9323,"Note that there can only
be one 4th term."
9324,"There can only be one -th term for any particular value of . So
for any input (the position of the term), there is only one output (the term)."
9325,"It would
be perfectly reasonable to write (4)"
9326,"= 3, and that really does look like a function.
"
9327,"But we like to use subscripts.
"
9328,We can also describe the terms in a sequence using a table.
9329,"We might write
something like the following:

1
2
3
4
...

1
3
6
10
...
"
9330,"This looks exactly like how you would represent a function, even though this table
describes the sequence of triangular numbers (we will see why they are called this
later).
"
9331,"Since sequences are functions, we can use any of the techniques to describe
functions to describe sequences."
9332,"In particular, we might give a closed formula for a

9333,"Discrete Structures
9
sequence by explicitly giving the function for the -th term."
9334,"For example,
= (+ 1)
2
.
"
9335,"Alternatively, we could define a sequence recursively by saying how to get from
one term to the next."
9336,"This is especially useful for the Fibonacci sequence:
= 1 + 2; 1 = 1, 2 = 1.
"
9337,"Much of our effort in understanding sequences will go into taking a recursive
definition and finding a closed formula for the sequence."
9338,"We will study this, and
everything else sequence related in Chapter 4.
0.2.5
Relations
How are the numbers 2 and 6 related?"
9339,"Oh, I know: 2 < 6."
9340,"Also, 6 is a multiple of 2.
"
9341,The two numbers are also both even.
9342,"And here is another fact: They are not equal.
"
9343,"All four of these are examples of relations: less than, multiple of, both even, not
equal."
9344,"And there are many more (infinitely many) relations for pairs of numbers.
"
9345,"The examples above are all binary relations in that they relate two elements.
"
9346,You could also consider relations between more than two elements.
9347,"For example,
we could consider the relation Pythagorean triple on three numbers that holds
precisely if they are the side lengths of a right triangle."
9348,"So the relation is true of the
triple (3, 4, 5), but not of (4, 5, 6) (since 32 + 42 = 52, but 42 + 52 62).
"
9349,Notice that we can talk about a pair or triple satisfying a relation.
9350,"We might say
that a pair belongs to the relation."
9351,"The careful and formal way to define a relation is
as a set of ordered pairs (or triples, etc.)."
9352,"Consider the (infinite) set of all ordered
pairs (, ) such that < . Every element of this set contains numbers for which
the relation less than is true, and every pair of numbers for which the relatio"
9353,"So we can say that this set of pairs is the relation.
"
9354,"Relations can have some standard properties, and deciding whether a particular
relation has a given property can often help us understand the relation better."
9355,"The
less-than relation is, for example, irreflexive because there are no elements that are
less than themselves."
9356,"It is also antisymmetric since there are no distinct numbers 
and such that < and < ."
9357,It is also transitive since if < and <
9358,"then it
must follow that < ."
9359,"These are just a few examples of relation properties though.
"
9360,Why would we care about these properties?
9361,"It turns out that some groups of
properties happen together frequently, and for such collections of properties, we
can prove general results about the relations that satisfy them."
9362,"So if we can prove
that a given relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (whatever those mean),
then we know the relation is an equivalence relation, and therefore we know it
has a bunch of ot"
9363,"A large portion of discrete mathematics is about
studying particular types of relations."
9364,"One of my favorites is a relation that gives us
a graph.

Graphs
Consider the set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
9366,"Which pairs of numbers from that set add
up to 7?"
9367,"We could have {1, 6} or {2, 5} or {3, 4}."
9368,"We can picture the set and the
interesting (unordered) pairs (i.e., two-element subsets) as a picture called a graph:
1

We call these discrete structures graphs."
9371,"A graph is a type of relation, one that is
symmetric (if is related to , then is related to ) and irreflexive (no element is
related to itself).
"
9372,"However, we mostly think of graphs as the drawings of dots and lines, or more
precisely as a set of vertices together with a set of edges, where each edge is a
two-element subset of the vertices."
9373,"Notice that even here, we are using the structure
set to define the structure graph.
"
9374,"Graphs show up in all sorts of real-world applications: In a class, some students
are friends with each other, so take the students to be the vertices and the edges to be
the friendships."
9375,"In geography, some countries share a border, so take the countries
to be the vertices and connect a pair of vertices with an edge if the countries share a
border."
9376,Perhaps you are planning a trip and want to fly from Denver to Paris.
9377,"Is
there a direct flight, or must you stop in Newark?"
9378,"That is, does the graph of flights
have an edge between Denver and Paris or only between Denver and Newark and
between Newark and Paris?"
9379,"When your Amazon driver delivers packages to 10
houses in your neighborhood, how does her app know in which order to deliver the
packages?"

hold doctorate degrees and write hundreds of papers each year."

surface of this fascinating subject in Chapter 2

Our list of structures could go on and on, but we will stop here."

repeated elements."

we will not get to groups or rings or metroids or POSets or Boolean algebras or ....
"
9387,"These are examples of sets on which we define additional operations and study the
algebraic structure of how the sets and operations interact.

Logic and Proofs
Logic is the study of consequence."
9402,"Given a few mathematical statements or facts, we
would like to be able to draw some conclusions."
9403,"For example, if I told you that a
particular real-valued function was continuous on the interval [0, 1], and (0) = 1
and (1) = 5, can we conclude that there is some point between [0, 1] where the
grap"
9404,"Yes, we can, thanks to the Intermediate
Value Theorem from calculus."
9405,"Can we conclude that there is exactly one point?
"
9406,"Whenever we find an answer in math, we really have a (perhaps hidden)
argument.
"
9407,"Mathematics is really about establishing general statements (like the Intermediate
Value Theorem)."
9408,This is done via an argument called a proof.
9409,"We start with some
given conditions, the premises of our argument, and from these, we find a consequence
of interest, our conclusion.
"
9410,"The problem is, as you no doubt know from arguing with friends, not all
arguments are good arguments."
9411,"A bad argument is one in which the conclusion does
not follow from the premises; i.e., the conclusion is not a consequence of the premises.
"
9412,Logic is the study of what makes an argument good or bad.
9413,"In other words, logic
aims to determine in which cases a conclusion is, or is not, a consequence of a set of
premises.
"
9414,"We will start in Section 1.1 by considering statements, the building blocks of
arguments."
9415,"Understanding what counts as a statement and what form statements
can take is the first step in understanding arguments."
9416,"We will take a closer look at
how statements can be combined in Section 1.2."
9417,"Then we will see what mathematical
tools we can develop to better analyze these statements and how they interact in
Section 1.3."

always lies."
9425,"The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each
as either a knight or a knave."
9426,"Each troll makes a single statement:
Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.
"
9427,"Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.

could you conclude if you knew Troll 1 really was a knave (i.e., their statement
was false)?"
9432,"Share your initial thoughts on this.
"
9433,"In order to do mathematics, we must be able to talk and write about mathematics.
"
9434,"Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding
numerical answers to problems."
9435,"As we embark towards more advanced and abstract
mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.
"
9436,"In fact, the primary goal of mathematics, as an academic discipline in its own
right, is to establish general mathematical truths."
9437,"How can we know whether these
facts, perhaps called theorems or propositions, are true?"
9438,"We construct valid arguments,
called proofs, which establish the truth of the statements."
9439,"Here, an argument is not
the sort of thing you have with your Mom when you disagree about what to have
for dinner."
9440,"Rather, we have a technical definition of the term.
"
9441,"Definition 1.1.2 Argument.
"
9442,"An argument is a sequence of statements, the last of which is called the
conclusion and the rest of which are called premises.
"
9443,"An argument is said to be valid provided the conclusion must be true
whenever the premises are all true."
9444,"An argument is invalid if it is not valid;
that is, all the premises can be true, and the conclusion could still be false.
"
9445,An argument is sound provided it is valid and all the premises are true.
9446,"A
proof of a statement is a sound argument whose conclusion is the statement.

By the way..."
9448,"Our definitions of argument, valid argument, and sound
argument are the same ones used in philosophy, the other primary academic
discipline concerned with logic and reasoning.
"
9449,"To determine whether we have a proof of a statement, we must decide both
whether every premise is true, and whether the argument is valid: whether the
conclusion follows from the premises."
9450,"How can we do this?
"
9451,"Example 1.1.3
Consider the following two arguments:
If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie.
"
9452,"Edith eats her vegetables.
"
9453,"
Edith gets a cookie.
"
9454,"Florence must eat her vegetables to get a cookie.
"
9455,"Florence eats her vegetables.
"
9456,"
Florence gets a cookie.
"
9457,"(The symbol  means therefore)
"
9458,"Are these arguments valid?
Solution.
"
9459,"Do you agree that the first argument is valid but the second
argument is not?"
9460,"We will soon develop a better understanding of the logic
involved in this analysis, but if your intuition agrees with this assessment,
then you are in good shape.
"
9461,Notice the two arguments look almost identical.
9462,"Edith and Florence both
eat their vegetables."
9463,"In both cases, there is a connection between the eating of
vegetables and cookies."
9464,"Yet we claim that it is valid to conclude that Edith gets
a cookie, but not that Florence does."
9465,"The difference must be in the connection
between eating vegetables and getting cookies."
9466,"We need to be skilled at
reading and comprehending these sentences."
9467,"Do the two sentences mean the
same thing?
"
9468,"Unfortunately, in everyday language we are often sloppy, and you might
be tempted to say they are equivalent."
9469,"But notice that just because Florence
must eat her vegetables, we have not claimed that doing so would be enough
(she might also need to clean her room, for example)."
9470,"In everyday (non-
mathematical) practice, you might be tempted to say this other direction is
implied."
9471,"In mathematics, we never get that luxury.
"
9472,"The arguments in the example above illustrate another important
point: Even if you dont care about the advancement of human knowledge in

mathematics to solve problems in some other discipline, it is still necessary to
demonstrate that your solution is correct."
9476,"You better have a good argument
that it is!
"
9477,"Since arguments are built up of statements, we must agree on what counts as a
statement.

A statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false.

Atomic and Molecular Statements
A statement is any declarative sentence which is either true or false."
9512,"A statement
is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called
molecular.

"
9513,"Logic and Proofs
Example 1.1.6
"
9514,"These are statements (in fact, atomic statements):
 Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.
"
9515,"The moon is made of cheese.
"
9516," 42 is a perfect square.
"
9517," Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two

 Go to your room!
"
9522," 3 + = 12
"
9523,"The reason the sentence 3 + = 12 is not a statement is that it contains a
variable."
9524,"Depending on what is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now
it is neither."
9525,"One way to make the sentence into a statement is to specify the value of
the variable in some way."
9526,"This could be done by setting a specific substitution, for
example, 3 + = 12 where = 9, which is a true statement."
9527,"Or you could capture
the free variable by quantifying over it, as in, For all values of , 3 + = 12, which
is false."
9528,"We will discuss quantifiers in more detail in the subsection Quantifiers and
Predicates below.
"
9529,"You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic
or molecular) ones using logical connectives."
9530,"For example, this is a molecular
statement:
Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits, and 42 is a perfect square.
"
9531,Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements.
9532,"The two shorter
statements are connected by an and."
9533,"We will consider 5 connectives: and (Sam
is a man, and Chris is a woman), or (Sam is a man, or Chris is a woman), if. . ."
9534,",
then. . . "
9535,"(if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), if and only if (Sam is a man
if and only if Chris is a woman), and not (Sam is not a man)."
9536,"The first four are
called binary connectives (because they connect two statements) while not is an
example of a unary connective (since it applies to a single statement).
"
9537,"These molecular statements are, of course, still statements, so they must be either
true or false."
9538,"The crucial observation here is that which truth value the molecular

9539,"Mathematical Statements

statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth
values of the parts."
9540,"We do not need to know what the parts actually say or whether
they have some material connection to each other, only whether those parts are true
or false.
"
9541,"To analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider propositional variables
(sometimes called sentential variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the
alphabet: , , , , . ."
9542,"We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic)
statements, but there are only two values the variables can achieve: true or false.1
We also have symbols for the logical connectives: , , , , .

"
9558,"For example, we can use the truth table for to decide whether the
statement, If 5 is even, then 6 is even, is true or false."
9559,"Here is the statement 5 is
even, and is the statement 6 is even."
9560,"Since 5 is not even, the statement is false.
"
9561,"Since 6 is even, the statement is true."
9562,"The truth table tells us that the statement
is true when is false and is true (the 3rd row)."
9563,"So the statement, If 5 is
even, then 6 is even, is true."

that thought, and we will hopefully resolve it soon.)

9565,"As for the other

9566,"The biconditional
(if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the
two parts of the statements are equivalent in that they have the same truth value.
"
9567,"This leaves only the implication which has a slightly different meaning
in mathematics than in ordinary usage."
9568,"However, implications are so common and
useful in mathematics that we must develop a level of fluency with their use which
warrants a whole section (Section 1.2).

"
9576,"8. 17 is not prime if and only if 19 is not prime.

9577,"Mathematical Statements
21
Solution.
"
9578,"First, lets agree on some facts: 17 really is prime and odd, 18 is
not either, and 19 is prime.
"
9579,"Both parts of the conjunction are true, so the entire statement is
true.
"
9580,"The first part is true, but the second part is false, so the entire
statement is false.
"
9581,"The first part is true, so the entire statement is true."
9582,"As soon as
we see one true statement in a disjunction, we can stop checking and
declare the entire statement true.
"
9583,"Since we use the inclusive or, the statement is true when both
parts are true.
"
9584,"Dont be worried that there isnt a good reason that 17 being
prime causes 19 to be prime."
9585,"That is not what we mean by a conditional
statement."
9586,"Since the then part is true, we know that the statement
overall is true.
"
9587,The if part of the statement is false.
9588,Thats all we need.
9589,"I bet
you dont even know what my favorite number is, and you dont need
to."
9590,"The statement is true.
"
9591,Do both parts have the same truth value?
9592,"Yes, since they are both
true."
9593,"So the entire statement is true.
"
9594,True as well.
9595,"Now both parts are false (since both are the negation of a
true statement), so the entire statement is true.
"
9596,"The way we define logical connectives and their truth value is very precise and
technical."
9597,"Often, language is not."
9598,"Part of learning how to communicate mathematics
is learning the cultural norms of mathematical language and how to translate
statements in ordinary language into these technical statements."
9599,"This will get easier
with practice, so make sure you are talking to lots of people about the math you are
studying.
"
9600,"Here are a few examples of how ordinary language might be difficult to translate.
"
9601,"Example 1.1.11
Identify the logical structure of each of the following statements.
"
9602,"1. 4 and 5 are both prime.
"
9603,"Only one of 4 or 5 is prime.
"
9604,"You must attend every day and do the homework to pass this class.

"
9605,"Logic and Proofs
4."
9606,"Every number is even or odd.
"
9607,"Do you agree this is the same statement as 4 is prime, and 5 is prime?
"
9608,"Notice that it would not make sense to write this as where is
4 and is 5 is prime."
9609,"But if we let be the statement, 4 is prime,
then both parts of the conjunction are statements.
"
9610,"Again, we cant just put what is on one side of the or as a statement.
"
9611,"But if we let be 4 is prime and be 5 is prime,, then we can write
this as () ()."
9612,"That is, either 4 is prime or 5 is prime, and it
is not the case that both 4 is prime and 5 is prime.
"
9613,"Here is another way you could phrase the same statement: If you pass
the class, then it must be the case that you attended every day and that
you did the homework."
9614,"If we agree that this is just a clearer way to
state the original statement, then we could illustrate its structure as
().
"
9615,"4. Notice that this is not the same as saying, Every number is even, or
every number is odd."
9616,"Of course, saying, 3 is even or odd, is the same
as saying, 3 is even, or 3 is odd."
9617,"Language is confusing!
"
9618,"We dont yet have the logical technology to translate this statement as
anything more than , where is the statement, Every number is even
or odd."
9619,"Luckily, that technology is available, starting... now!
1.1.3
Quantifiers and Predicates
Did you know that all mammals have hair?"
9620,That every integer is even or odd?
9621,"That
some odd numbers are not prime?
"
9622,"Our goal is to explore how to write statements such as these in mathematical
notation to highlight the logical structure of the statements.
"
9623,"This will require considering a new sort of basic sentence called a predicate,
which is like a statement, but contains a free variable."
9624,"When you replace that
variable with a constant of some sort, then the sentence becomes a statement proper.
"
9625,"Think of a predicate as making a claim about the values that are substituted for the
placeholder variable(s).
"
9626,"A predicate can be made into a (true or false) statement by evaluating it at some
constant(s), or we can claim that some or all possible constants would make the
resulting statement true or false."
9627,"This is done using quantifiers.

"
9628,"Mathematical Statements
23
Definition 1.1.12 Quantifiers.
"
9629,"The universal quantifier is written and is read, for all."
9630,"The existential
quantifier is written and is read, there exists or for some.
"
9631,"We usually write predicates similar to how you write a function, although with
capital letters."
9632,"For example, we might use the predicate () to represent is
prime."
9633,"We can then say that (7) is true (since 7 is prime) and that (8) is false.
"
9634,"Or using quantifiers, we can (falsely) claim that all numbers are prime by writing
() or (truthfully) claim that there is at least one prime number, by writing
().
"
9635,"Example 1.1.13
Translate the statement, Every number is even or odd, into symbols.
"
9636,"Before we even start using symbols, it is helpful to rephrase this
in a way that captures the logical structure of the statement."
9637,"What is the claim
saying?"
9638,"Given any number, it will either be the case that the number is even,
or that the number is odd."
9639,"In particular, we are not claiming that either all
numbers are even or all numbers are odd.
"
9640,"Lets use () to say that is even, and () to say that is odd."
9641,"Then we
can write,
() ()
to say that is even or is odd."
9642,"Which is that true for (according to the
claim)?"
9643,All of them.
9644,"So we write the statement as,
(() ()).
"
9645,"We added some parentheses to emphasize that the scope of the universal
quantifier includes both predicates.
"
9646,"Note that if we incorrectly interpreted the statement as claiming that
either all numbers are even or all numbers are odd, we could write that as
() ()."
9647,"This is not the same!
"
9648,"Just like we did for propositional logic and the logical connectives, we should
decide what it means for a quantified predicate to be true or false."
9649,"We say ()
is true if () is true no matter what constant we substitute for . And similarly,
() is true if there is at least one value for which () is true.
"
9650,"However, we must be careful here."
9651,"Consider the statement
(< ).
"
9652,"You would read this, For every there is some such"
9653,"that is less than . Note
that < is a predicate with two free variables; we have chosen to write it with the
symbol between the variables instead of the funky-looking (, ) or <(, ).

"
9654,"Logic and Proofs
Is this statement true?"
9655,The answer depends on our domain of discourse.
9656,"When
we say for all , do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elephants
or...?"
9657,"Usually, this information is implied by the context of the statement."
9658,"In discrete
mathematics, we almost always quantify over the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, . ."
9659,"., so lets
take that for our domain of discourse here.
"
9660,"For the statement to be true, we need, no matter what natural number we select,
for there to be some natural number that is strictly smaller."
9661,"Perhaps we could let
be 1?"
9662,But here is the problem: what if = 0?
9663,"Then = 1, and that is not
a number!"
9664,(in our domain of discourse).
9665,"Thus we see that the statement is false
because there is a number less than or equal to all other numbers."
9666,"In symbols,
().
"
9667,"We will explore some rules for working with quantifiers and other connectives
in Section 1.3."
9668,"For now, we will focus on translating between informal statements
in ordinary language and the more precise language of logic."
9669,"There is no perfect
algorithm for doing this translation, but here are a few useful rules of thumb.
"
9670,"Every blank is blank.
"
9671,"Any statement of the form, Every -thing is a -thing can be written as
(() ()).
"
9672,"Example: all mammals have hair, becomes (() ()), where
() means is a mammal, and () means has hair.
"
9673,"To make sense of this, think about what we mean by statements like these in
terms of sets."
9674,"We claim that the set of mammals is contained in, or is a subset of, the
set of hairy things."
9675,"What we mean by is a subset of  is precisely that every
element of is an element of ."
9676,"This can also be expressed by saying that if is an
element of , then is also an element of .
Some blanks are blank.
"
9677,"Any statement of the form, Some -things are -things, can be written
as
(() ()).
"
9678,"Example: Some cats can swim, becomes (() ()), where ()
means is a cat, and () means can swim.
"
9679,"Again, it is helpful to think of how to express such statements in terms of sets.
"
9680,"To say that some cats can swim is to say that there are things that belong both to the
set of cats and to the set of swimming things."
9681,"Such animals belong to the intersection
of these two sets, which you can describe as belonging to the first set and the second
set."
9682,"Existential statements of this form claim that the intersection of the two sets is
not empty.

"
9683,"Mathematical Statements
25
Implicit Quantifiers.
"
9684,It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.
9685,"Some-
times though, we can relax a bit, as long as we all agree on a convention."
9686,"An example
of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free
variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.
"
9687,"For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?"
9688,"But
how can that be true if it is not a statement?"
9689,"To be a little more precise, we have two
predicates: () for is a square and () for is a rectangle."
9690,"The sentence we
are looking at is
() ().
"
9691,"This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement."
9692,But come on!
9693,"We all know that
we meant to consider the statement,
(() ()),
and this is what our convention tells us to consider."
9694,"We call the resulting statement
the universal generalization of the original sentence.
"
9695,"Definition 1.1.14
Given a sentence with free variables, the universal generalization of that
sentence is the statement obtained by adding enough universal quantifiers to
the beginning of the sentence "
9696,"Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate
and a statement."
9697,"For example, we might write, let () be the statement, is prime,
which is technically incorrect."
9698,"It is implicit that we mean that we are defining ()
to be a predicate, which for each becomes the statement, is prime.

Understanding the Truth Table
"
9857,"The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts.
"
9858,"Our definition of the truth conditions for an implication says that there is only one
way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is
false.

"
9859,"Implications

Example 1.2.3
Consider the statement:
If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.
"
9860,"This is definitely an implication: is the statement Bob gets a 90 on the final,
and is the statement Bob will pass the class.
"
9861,Suppose I made that statement to Bob.
9862,"In what circumstances would it be
fair to call me a liar?"
9863,"What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did
pass the class?"
9864,Then I have not lied; my statement is true.
9865,"However, if Bob
did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the
statement false."
9866,"The tricky case is this: What if Bob did not get a 90 on the
final?"
9867,"Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesnt."
9868,Did I lie in either case?
9869,"I
think not."
9870,"In these last two cases, was false, and the statement was
true."
9871,"In the first case, was true, and so was . So is true when
either is false or is true.
"
9872,"Just to be clear, although we sometimes read as implies , we are
not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements and 
(although there might be)."
9873,"If < , then + 1 < + 1, is a true statement (or at
least, its universal generalization is)."
9874,"We know it is true because we understand how
the two parts interact."
9875,"If you add 1 to two numbers and , then their order does
not change."
9876,"But the statement, if 1 < 2, then Euclid studied geometry is also a
true implication.
"
9877,"Example 1.2.4
Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false."
9878,"If 1 = 1, then most horses have 4 legs.
"
9879,"If 0 = 1, then 1 = 1.
3."
9880,"If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of is an 8.
4."
9881,"If the 7624th digit of is an 8, then 2 + 2 = 4.
Solution.
"
9882,All four of the statements are true.
9883,"Remember, the only way for
an implication to be false is for the if part to be true and the then part to be
false.
"
9884,"Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so the implication
is true."
9885,"It does not matter that there is no meaningful connection
between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.

2."
9887,"Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the implication
is true.
"
9888,"I have no idea what the 7624th digit of is, but this does not matter.
"
9889,"Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is automatically true.
"
9890,"Regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true,
making the implication true.
"
9891,This is a strange example and isnt really how we use implications anyway.
9892,"This
strangeness is not just mathematicians being stubborn though."
9893,"The truth conditions
for implications must be like they are for mathematics to make sense."
9894,"Lets see why.
"
9895,"Example 1.2.5
Consider the statement, All squares are rectangles, which can also be
phrased as, For all shapes, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle."
9896,"Is
this statement true or false?"
9897,Are we sure?
9898,"What about the following three
shapes?
Solution.
"
9899,Of course the statement is true.
9900,"A square is a 4-sided plane figure
with 4 right angles and 4 equal-length sides, while a rectangle is a 4-sided
plane figure with 4 right angles.
"
9901,"However, what we mean when we consider a universal statement like
this is that, no matter what we plug in for the variable (the shape in this
case), the resulting statement is true."
9902,"When the statement is about a particular
shape, we have an implication ."
9903,"This means it must be true that, if the
actual shape on the left is a square, then it is a rectangle."
9904,"The shape is a
square (is true) and is a rectangle (is true), so yes, the implication is true.
"
9905,Is the implication true of the rectangle in the middle?
9906,"Well, that shape
is not a square (is false), and it is a rectangle (is true)."
9907,"But look, we
believe that all squares are rectangles, so the statement must be true."
9908,"Even of
a rectangle."
9909,"The only way this works is if true implies false is true!
"
9910,"Similarly, all squares are rectangles is a true statement, even when we look
at a triangle."
9911,"is false (the triangle is not a square), and is false (the triangle
is not a rectangle)."
9912,"Thankfully, we defined implications to be true in this case
as well.
"
9913,"We have given shapes that illustrate lines 1, 3, and 4 of the truth table for
implications (Figure 1.2.2)."
9914,What shape illustrates line 2?

9917,"Of course we cant
find one, precisely because the statement is true!
"
9918,"1.2.3
Related Statements
An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements."
9919,"It is
often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements.
"
9920,"Here we introduce some common language to address this question.
"
9921,"Definition 1.2.6 Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse.
"
9922,"Given an implication , we say,
"
9923,"The converse is the statement .
"
9924,"The contrapositive is the statement .
"
9925,"The inverse is the statement, .
Example 1.2.7
Consider the implication, If you clean your room, then you can go to the
party."
9926,"Give the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of this statement
Solution.
"
9927,"The converse is, If you can go to the party, then you clean your
room.
"
9928,"The contrapositive is, If you cant go to the party, then you dont clean
your room.
"
9929,"The inverse is, If you dont clean your room, then you cant go to the
party.
"
9930,"Symbolically, both the converse and the contrapositive switch the order of the two
parts of the statement (or alternatively, think about turning the arrow to point in the
other direction)."
9931,"The contrapositive and the inverse take the negation of both of the
statements."
9932,"Notice that if you take the converse (switch the order) and then take the
contrapositive of that converse (switch the order back and negate both parts) you get
the inverse."
9933,"So the inverse is nothing more than the contrapositive of the converse.
"
9934,"Or the converse of the contrapositive, which is a fun fact to mention at parties.
"
9935,"When considering statements with quantifiers, we ignore the outside quantifiers
when forming the converse, contrapositive, and inverse.

"
9936,"Logic and Proofs
Quantifiers and the Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse.
"
9937,"A quantified implication (() ()) has:
Converse
(() ())
"
9938,"Contrapositive
(() ())
"
9939,"Inverse
(() ())
"
9940,"Note 1.2.8 It is unlikely that we would encounter a statement of the form
(() ()), since this would be automatically true if there was any
that made () false."
9941,"But if we did, the same rules would apply to the
converse, contrapositive, and inverse as above: Just ignore the quantifier when
swapping and/or negating the parts of the implication.
"
9942,"For example, For all shapes, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle (i.e.,
all squares are rectangles) has the converse, For all shapes, if the shape is a rectangle,
then it is a square (so "
9943,"Well, thats not true!"
9944,"There exist shapes that are rectangles and are NOT squares.
"
9945,"Indeed, this is an example of a statement that is true with a false converse."
9946,"There are
lots of examples of this throughout mathematics."
9947,"There are also examples of true
implications that have true converses."
9948,"You just cant know from the logic.2
The contrapositive of For all shapes, if it is a square, then it is a rectangle is
For all shapes, if the shape is not a rectangle, then it is not a square."
9949,This is true.
9950,"In
fact, the contrapositive of a true statement is always true!
"
9951,"Since the contrapositive of an implication always has the same truth value as its
original implication, it can often be helpful to analyze the contrapositive to decide
whether an implication is true.
"
9952,"Example 1.2.9
True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then
you will have at least three cards all of the same suit."
9953,"Is the converse true?
Solution.
"
9954,"The original implication is a little hard to analyze because
there are so many combinations of nine cards."
9955,"But consider the contrapositive:
if you dont have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you dont have
nine cards."
9956,It is easy to see why this is true.
9957,"If you dont have at least three
cards in a suit, you can have at most two cards of each of the four suits, for a
total of at most eight cards.
"
9958,2It turns out the Pythagorean Theorem is one such statement.
9959,"It is also true that if 2 + 2 = 2,
then there is a right triangle with legs of lengths and and hypotenuse of length ."
9960,"So we could have
also written the theorem as a biconditional: and are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle with
hypotenuse of length if and only if 2 + 2 = 2.

1.2."
9961,"Implications
37
The converse: If you have at least three cards of the same suit, then you
have nine cards."
9962,This is false.
9963,"You could have three spades and nothing
else."
9964,"Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we
provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards
of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false "
9965,"In other words, we find some example that puts us in row 2 of the
implications truth table.
"
9966,"Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications
and their truth values:

9967,"Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the
following cases:
"
9968,"Sue gets a 93% on her final.
"
9969,"Sue gets an A in the class.
"
9970,"Sue does not get a 93% on her final.
"
9971,"Sue does not get an A in the class.
Solution.
"
9972,"Note first that whenever and are both true statements,
must be true as well."
9973,"For this problem, take to mean Sue gets a 93% on
her final and to mean Sue will get an A in the class.
"
9974,"We have and , so follows."
9975,"Sue gets an A.
2."
9976,You cannot conclude anything.
9977,"Sue could have gotten the A because
she did extra credit, for example."
9978,"Notice that we do not know that if
Sue gets an , then she gets a 93% on her final."
9979,"That is the converse of
the original implication, so it might or might not be true.
"
9980,"The contrapositive of the converse of is , which states
that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then she will not get an A in
the class."
9981,But this does not follow from the original implication.
9982,"Again,
we can conclude nothing."
9983,"Sue could have done extra credit.
"
9984,"What would happen if Sue did not get an A but did get a 93% on the
final?"
9985,"Then would be true, and would be false."
9986,"This makes the
implication false!"
9987,"It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on
the final."
9988,"Notice we now have the implication which is the
contrapositive of . Since is assumed to be true, we know
is true as well.

"
9989,"Logic and Proofs
As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it
is possible that both the implication and its converse are true."
9990,"In this case, when
both and are true, we say that and are equivalent and write
. This is the biconditional we mentioned in Section 1.1.
"
9991,"You can think of if and only if statements as having two parts: an implication
and its converse."
9992,"We might say one is the if part, and the other is the only if
part."
9993,"We also sometimes say that if and only if statements have two directions: a
forward direction () and a backward direction (, which is really just
sloppy notation for ).
"
9994,Lets think a little about which part is which.
9995,"Is the if part or the only
if part?"
9996,"Consider an example.
"
9997,"Example 1.2.11
Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if Im in the shower."
9998,"We know this
means both that if I sing, then Im in the shower, and also the converse, that if
Im in the shower, then I sing."
9999,"Let be the statement, I sing, and be, Im
in the shower."
10000,"So is the statement if I sing, then Im in the shower.
"
10001,"Which part of the if and only if statement is this?

and I sing only if Im in the shower."
10002,"When is the first one (the if part)
false?"
10003,When I am in the shower but not singing.
10004,"That is the same condition
for being false as the statement, If Im in the shower, then I sing."
10005,"So the if
part is ."
10006,"On the other hand, to say, I sing only if Im in the shower is

mint green."
10134,He always wears either the green vest or red shoes.
10135,"Whenever
he wears a purple shirt and the green vest, he chooses to not wear a bow tie.
"
10136,"He never wears the green vest unless he is also wearing either a purple shirt
or red shoes."
10137,"Whenever he wears red shoes, he also wears a purple shirt.

10138,"Today, Holmes wore a bow tie."
10139,"What else did he wear?

Spend a few minutes thinking about the Investigate! question above."
10141,"Of the six
statements in the puzzle, only one is atomic."
10142,"Use this atomic statement and
one other statement to deduce a new statement about what Holmes might (or
might not) be wearing."
10143,"Explain why you think your new statement is true.
"
10144,"The atomic statement is, Holmes wore a bow tie."
10145,"Only one of the
molecular statements has this as one of its atoms.
"
10146,Logic studies the ways statements can interact with each other.
10147,"More precisely,
we consider the way the logical form statements can interact."
10148,"The study of logic does
not care about the content of the atomic statements or the meaning of predicates.
"
10149,"For example, the claims, If spiders have six legs, then Sam walks with a limp, and,
If the moon is made of cheese, then cheddar is a type of cheese, are identical from a
logical perspective."
10150,"Logic doesnt care about whether Sam is a spider or the culinary
makeup of the moon."
10151,"Both statements have the same form: They are implications,
.
Of course, in mathematics we often do know some relationship between various

10152,"Rules of Logic
45
atomic statements."
10153,"For example, we know a relationship between being even and
being a multiple of 10."
10154,"That relationship allows us to make claims such as, If
the number Im thinking of is a multiple of 10, then it is even."
10155,"Suppose I also
told you that I am now thinking of a number that is not even."
10156,"We can deduce
that I am not thinking of a multiple of 10!"
10157,"Crucially, if we accept the truth of the
statements here, we can make this deduction without thinking about the nature of
numbers."
10158,"It can feel very liberating and provide much-needed clarity when trying
to understand complicated reasoning if we can separate the content from the logical
form of arguments.
"
10159,"Our goal in this section is to establish some procedures for analyzing how the
truth or falsity of statements interact, based on their logical form."
10160,"We will see that
some molecular statements must be true regardless of whether their atomic parts
are true or false, while some statements must always be false."
10161,"For other statements,
it can be that two statements are always true or false together, or that whenever one
statement is true, another statement must also be true.
"
10162,"The main method for establishing these relationships will be truth tables.
"
10163,"There is a very clear procedure for constructing and analyzing truth tables, but for
complicated arguments that contain many atomic statements, the truth tables become
very large and unwieldy."
10164,"We will therefore use truth tables to understand some
basic equivalences and deductions that can be applied in a sequence of reasoning to
construct larger arguments.

Truth Tables
Heres a question about playing Monopoly:
If you get more doubles than any other player, then you will lose, or if
you lose, then you must have bought the most properties.
"
10177,True or false?
10178,"We will answer this question and wont need to know anything about
Monopoly."
10179,"Instead, we will look at the logical form of the statement.
"
10180,We need to decide when the statement () () is true.
10181,"Using the
definitions of the connectives in Definition 1.1.8, we see that for this to be true, either
must be true or must be true (or both)."
10182,"Those are true if either is
false or is true (in the first case) and is false or is true (in the second case).
"
10183,"Soyeah, it gets a bit messy."
10184,"Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the
possibilities with a truth table.
"
10185,"The idea is this: On each row, we list a possible combination of Ts and Fs (Trues
and Falses) for each of the propositional variables, and then mark down whether the
(molecular) statement in question "
10186,"We do this for every
possible combination of Ts and Fs."
10187,"Then we can clearly see the cases in which the
statement is true or false."
10188,"For complicated statements, we will first fill in values
for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more
manageable pieces.
"
10189,"Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values
of its parts and how they are connected, all you need to know is the truth tables for
each of the logical connectives,"

properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).

necessarily true based on its logical form alone."

10214,"This says that no matter what and are, the statements and

Since the truth values for the two statements are equal in every row, the two
statements are logically equivalent.
"
10233,"Notice that this example gives us a way to distribute a negation over a
disjunction (an or)."
10234,"We have a similar rule for distributing over conjunctions
(ands):
Theorem 1.3.7 De Morgans Laws.
"
10235,"The negation of a disjunction or conjunction is logically equivalent to a conjunction
or disjunction of negations, respectively."
10236,"That is,
()

1."
10238,"Logic and Proofs
(okay, there is: It is called Boolean algebra) to transform one statement into another.
"
10239,"We can start collecting useful examples of logical equivalence and apply them in
succession to a statement, instead of writing out a complicated truth table.
"
10240,"De Morgans laws do not directly help us with implications, but as we saw above,
every implication can be written as a disjunction:
Implications are Disjunctions.
"
10241,".
Example: If a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even is equivalent to,
A number is not a multiple of 4, or (else) it is even.
"
10242,"With this and De Morgans laws, you can take any statement and simplify it to the
point where negations are only being applied to atomic propositions."

that you could get multiple negations stacked up."

Equivalence for Quantified Statements
All the examples we have looked at so far have only involved propositional logic,
where the basic units of logic are statements that are either true or fals"
10265,"It is also
possible to say that two statements involving quantifiers and predicates are logically
equivalent.

"
10266,"Logic and Proofs
Sometimes the quantifiers have nothing to do with the equivalence."
10267,"For example,
(() ()) (() ()).
"
10268,"As soon as we replace the with a constant, we are left with two statements that are
logically equivalent based on their propositional form.
"
10269,"Other times, the more interesting times, it is exactly the logic of the quantifiers
that makes the statements logically equivalent."
10270,"What is especially interesting here is
that we cannot use truth tables to verify these equivalences!
"
10271,"Instead, we need to reason about the domain of discourse as a set."
10272,"For example,
lets consider how negation interacts with quantifiers.
"
10273,Consider the claim that all odd numbers are prime.
10274,"We might represent this
symbolically as (() ())."
10275,"The statement clearly is not true, so what is true
is that not all odd numbers are prime (i.e., (() ()))."
10276,"How do we know?
"
10277,"Yes, 9 is odd but not prime."
10278,"But is it enough that just one odd number isnt
prime?
To dispute a universal claim, you just need one single counterexample."
10279,"You just
need to show there exists a number for which the claim is false."
10280,"In our case, we have
the equivalence,
(() ()) (() ()).
"
10281,"If we ignore the quantifiers for a minute, we are left with
() 
which is exactly an example of Theorem 1.3.9."
10282,"The new, interesting part is that when
we negated the universal quantifier, we got an existential quantifier.
"
10283,Negating an existential quantifier results in a universal quantifier.
10284,"This makes
sense."
10285,"If there does not exist something with a property, then everything does not
have that property.

() is equivalent to ().
"
10287,"() is equivalent to ().
"
10288,"Symbolically, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes
the quantifier to switch type.
"
10289,"Another way to see why this makes sense: Universal quantifiers are like (possibly
infinite) conjunctions since they claim that the property is true of this thing, and
that thing, and the other thing,."
10290,"Existential quantifiers are like (possibly
infinite) disjunctions: The property is true of at least one thing, maybe this, or that,
or the other, or...."
10291,"De Morgans laws tell us that when we negate a conjunction, we
get a disjunction, and when we negate a disjunction, we get a conjunction."

great when everything works out as it should?

symbols as

"
10295,"(It is not true that there is a number such that for all numbers , is less
than or equal to .)
"
10296,"However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: We can pass a
negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal
and existential)."
10297,"So the statement above should be logically equivalent to
(< ).
"
10298,"Notice that < is the negation of . This reads, For every number 
there is a number which is smaller than ."
10299,"We see that this is another way
to make our original claim.

10300,"It is important to stress that predicate logic extends propositional logic (much
like how quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics)."
10301,"Everything that we
learned about logical equivalence and deductions still applies."
10302,"However, predicate
logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution, digging down into the
individual propositions , , etc.
To do this, we need to understand how quantifiers and connective"
10303,"We
have already seen something about negations and quantifiers."
10304,"What about the other
connectives?"

disjunctions can (or cannot) work together.

is every number even?"
10319,Is every number odd?
10320,"So the statement on
the right is false (it is a false or false).
"

"
10322,"That is,
(() ())"

Deductions
Earlier, we claimed that the following was a valid argument:
If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie."
10341,"Edith ate her
vegetables."
10342,"Therefore Edith gets a cookie.
"
10343,How do we know this is valid?
10344,Lets look at the form of the statements.
10345,"Let denote,
Edith eats her vegetables and denote, Edith can have a cookie."
10346,"The logical
form of the argument is then:




"
10347,"This is an example of a deduction rule, an argument form that is always valid."
10348,"This
one is a particularly famous rule called modus ponens."

valid deduction rule?"

correspond to both of these being true?"

To illustrate the importance of definitions in a proof, lets give a few careful
definitions about mini sudoku puzzles.
"
10547,"Definition 1.4.2 Mini Sudoku Definitions.
"
10548,"A mini sudoku puzzle is a partially filled in 4  4 grid of squares, divided
into four 2  2 boxes."
10549,"Each square can be empty or contain a digit from 1 to 4.
"
10550,"We say that a mini sudoku puzzle is valid provided no digit from 1 to 4
appears more than once in any row, any column, or any box.
"
10551,"A solution to a mini sudoku puzzle is a valid puzzle with no empty
squares and every non-empty square of the puzzle unchanged.
"
10552,"We say that a mini sudoku puzzle is solvable if there is exactly one
solution.
"
10553,"First, lets prove a useful and obvious fact about any valid mini sudoku puzzle.
"
10554,"Proposition 1.4.3
Any solution to a mini sudoku puzzle will have each digit from 1 to 4 appear exactly
once in each row, in each column, and in each box, appearing a total of four times.
"
10555,"Thats obvious, you say!"
10556,Isnt that exactly what a valid puzzle is?
10557,"Well, a valid
completed puzzle, which is what we mean by a solution, right?"
10558,"Okay, not exactly,
since valid means that no digit repeats... isnt that the same thing?
"
10559,"Saying this is a direct proof.
Proof."
10560,Suppose you have a solution to a mini sudoku puzzle.
10561,"That means that
you have a 4  4 grid with each square filled in with a digit from 1 to 4 that is
valid.a Since the puzzle is valid, no digit repeats in any row, any column, or any
boxb."
10562,"Since a row contains four numbers that do not repeat, and there are exactly
four possible digits, each of those digits must appear exactly once."
10563,"This is true for
every row, and for every column, and for every box.
"
10564,"For each digit, since it appears exactly once in four different rows, it appears
exactly four times."
10565,"This completes the proof.

bDefinition of valid
Remark 1.4.4"
10567,"The proof contained one key mathematical idea besides just
explaining definitions: If four distinct numbers are chosen from a set of four
numbers, then all four numbers are chosen."
10568,"Perhaps you want to also explain
why this is true, or just say it is an example of the pigeonhole principle (we
will say what this is soon)."
10569,"How much you explain depends on who you are
writing the proof for."
10570,"A little paranoia when writing proofs is healthy.
"
10571,"Indeed, in most contexts, we wouldnt even need to write out any of the

10572,"It would probably be sufficient to say, Clearly this follows

from the definitions."
10574,"However, we are currently trying to learn how to write
proofs, and it can be useful to be overly pedantic so we can focus on the proof
structure and the importance of applying definitions.
"
10575,"Lets prove something about a particular sudoku puzzle.
"
10576,"Example 1.4.5
Prove that for any solution to the mini sudoku puzzle below, if the solution
has a 2 in the top-left square (r1c1), then it will contain a 2 in the bottom-right
square (r4c4).

Solution.
"
10578,"We do not know whether the puzzle is solvable (in fact, it is not),
although note that it is valid right now."
10579,"What we want to prove is that if 2 is
in the top-left square in any particular solution, then that solution contains a 2
in the bottom-right square.
"
10580,"Let be a solution to the puzzle, and assume that contains a 2 in
the top-left square."
10581,"Since is a valid puzzle, no digit repeats in any row, any
column, or any box."
10582,Look first at the top row.
10583,"Since the row already contains
1, 2, and 3, the remaining open square (r1c4) must be a 4.
"
10584,Now look at column 4 (the right-most column).
10585,"Since we now know the
top-right square is a 4, this column already contains 1, 3, and 4."
10586,"So the last
open square (r4c4) must be a 2.
"
10587,"Thus contains a 2 in the bottom-left square, which is what we needed to
prove.
"
10588,"
Observe the general form of the argument above."
10589,"We were trying to prove an
implication :"
10590,"If there was a 2 in r1c1, then there was a 2 in r4c4."

assuming was true."

we fix an arbitrary valid mini sudoku puzzle."
10615,"We assume that it has a solution

Now consider the case where two of the empty squares are in the same
row, and the third square is in a different row."

has three different digits, so there is only one choice for the last square, and it

10626,"In each

Direct proof can, of course, be used to prove statements in mathematics too.

Proof by Contrapositive
Recall that an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive
."
10661,"There are plenty of examples of statements that are hard to prove directly,
but whose contrapositive can easily be proved using a direct proof."
10662,"This is all that
proof by contrapositive does."
10663,"It gives a direct proof of the contrapositive of the
implication."
10664,"This is enough because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the
original implication.
"
10665,"The skeleton of the proof of by contrapositive will always look roughly
like this:
Assume . Explain, explain, . . ."
10666,"Therefore .
As before, if there are variables and quantifiers, we set them to be arbitrary elements
of our domain.
"
10667,"Example 1.4.9
Prove that if a mini sudoku puzzle is solvable, then it is valid.
"
10668,"Remember, a puzzle is valid provided no row, column, or box
contains a repeated digit."
10669,"A puzzle is solvable if there is exactly one solution,
where a solution is a valid puzzle with no empty squares (that doesnt change
any previously filled-in square).
"
10670,"If we try a direct proof, we would start with an arbitrary puzzle and
assume it is solvable."
10671,"We could then get the solution, but would need to
reason back in time to when the puzzle started."
10672,This seems hard.
10673,"Often,
when a proof seems to require breaking things apart, it is easier to try the
contrapositive."
10674,"Thats what we will do.
Proof.
"
10675,"Let be an arbitrary mini sudoku puzzle and assume that it is not
valid."
10676,"This means that in at least one row, or one column, or one box, some
digit appears more than once.
"
10677,"Now suppose we have filled in the empty squares but not changed any
previously filled-in squares."
10678,"The original row, column, or box that contained
a duplicate digit will still contain that duplication, so the resulting completed
puzzle will not be valid."
10679,"Thus no solution to exists, so is not solvable."

We have proved that if a mini sudoku puzzle is not valid, then it is not
solvable, which is the contrapositive of what we wanted to prove and so

serves as a proof of the original statement.

10690,"This looks much more promising.

10691,We need a definition of a number being odd.
10692,"An integer is odd provided

10693,"Our proof will look something like this:
Let be an arbitrary integer."
10694,Suppose that is not even.

10696,In other words . . . .
10697,But this is the same as saying . . . .
10698,"Therefore 2 is not
even.
"
10699,"Now we fill in the details.
Proof.
"
10700,We will prove the contrapositive.
10701,"Let be an arbitrary integer.
"
10702,"Suppose that is not even, and thus odd."
10703,"Then = 2+ 1 for some integer
. Now 2 = (2+ 1)2 = 42 + 4+ 1 = 2(22 + 2)"

Example 1.4.11

10706,"The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to

10712,"Here is a complete proof.
Proof.
"
10713,Let and be integers.
10714,Assume that and are even.
10715,"Then = 2

10716,Now + = 2+

10718,"Since
+ is an integer, we see that + is even, completing the proof.

71
Note that our assumption that and are even is the negation of or is
odd."
10720,"We used De Morgans law here.
"
10721,"Direct proofs and proofs by contrapositive can be used when proving implications.
"
10722,"Remember that some statements that are not explicitly written as an implication can
be rephrased as one.
"
10723,"Example 1.4.12
Consider the statement, For every prime number , either = 2, or is odd.
"
10724,"We can rephrase this as, For every prime number , if 2, then is odd.

10725,"Now try to prove it.

10726,"Use the following as the definition of a prime number: An integer > 1 is
prime provided it has exactly two factors, namely 1 and .

Proof.
"
10727,Let be an arbitrary prime number.
10728,Assume is not odd.
10729,"So is
divisible by 2."
10730,"Since is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has
2 as a divisor, so must be divisible by only 1 and 2."
10731,Therefore = 2.
10732,"This
completes the proof (by contrapositive).
"
10733,"
1.4.4
Proof by Contradiction
Take a step back and consider what it would mean if the conclusion of an argument
were false."
10734,There are two reasons this could happen.
10735,"Either the logic in the argument
is faulty, or at least one assumption must be false."
10736,"A proof by contradiction exploits
this second possibility."
10737,"We start with a single assumption and construct a valid proof
that leads to a false conclusion; the only possibility is that the single assumption was
false."
10738,"The false conclusion is the contradiction, which just means a necessarily
false statement (technically a statement of the form ).
"
10739,"The general form of a proof by contradiction to prove a statement is,
Assume (that is not true)."
10740,"This means that..., which tells us..., so
we can say..."
10741,"But that is a contradiction, so must in fact be true.
"
10742,"Note that if we think of this style of argument as a direct proof of something, it is a
direct proof of
contradiction.
"
10743,So we have a valid proof of this implication.
10744,"How can a true implication have a false
conclusion?"
10745,Recall the truth table for an implication (Figure 1.2.2).
10746,"The only row
in which the implication is true but the conclusion is false is row 4, and here the
hypothesis is also false."
10747,"So is false, which is to say is true.
"
10748,"Once you start writing proofs by contradiction, it becomes very natural."
10749,"Lets
see how with a sudoku proof.

the top-right corner (r1c4).

"
10752,"There are multiple ways we could prove this, which is often the
case for proofs by contradiction."
10753,"While we would always start with the
same initial assumption (the opposite of what we want to prove), where the
contradiction is found can vary.
Proof.
"
10754,"Let be a solution to the puzzle, but assume that does not contain a
3 in the top-right corner."
10755,"Then the top row must contain a 3 somewhere else.
"
10756,"It cannot be in column 1, since it already has a 3."
10757,"It cannot be in column 2,
since that square is already filled in (with the 2)."
10758,"It also cannot be in column
3, since if it was, there would be no place to put a three in the bottom row."
10759,"So
there would be no 3 in the top row, contradicting that is a solution.
"
10760,"Therefore must contain a 3 in the top-right corner.

10761,"
Example 1.4.14

Solution.
"
10763,"Look at the logical format of this statement:
(is a solution ).
"
10764,"Using the rules for negation of quantifiers, this is the same as
(is not a solution).
"
10765,"If we were to prove this directly, we would need to consider all possible
solutions and show that they are not valid."
10766,"That seems quite challenging.

1.4."
10767,"Proofs
73
On the other hand, if we try a proof by contradiction, we get to assume
the negation of the statement we are asked to prove."
10768,"That is, we can assume
that there is a solution."
10769,That is a single solution we can reason about.
10770,"Much
more manageable.
Proof.
"
10771,"Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there does exist a solution
to the puzzle."
10772,This solution must have a 4 in the bottom-left box.
10773,"But the only
squares that can hold a 4 are either in row 4 or column 1 (or both)."
10774,"In either
case, this contradicts that there is a 4 already in column 1 and row 4.

Here are three examples of proofs by contradiction about numbers:
Example 1.4.15
Prove that

2 is irrational.
"
10775,"Proof.
Suppose not."
10776,"Then

2 is equal to a fraction

10777,"Without loss of
generality, assume 
is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction)."
10778,"So,
2 = 2
2
22 = 2.
"
10779,"Thus 2 is even, and as such is even."
10780,"So = 2for some integer , and
2 = 42."
10781,"We then have,
22 = 42
2 = 22.
"
10782,"Thus 2 is even, and as such is even."
10783,"Since is also even, we see that

not in lowest terms, a contradiction."

2 is irrational.

Example 1.4.16

turn gives 22 = (2+ 1)."

While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have
also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the
negation of the hypothesis.

Summary of Proof Styles
We have considered three styles of proof: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and

assumption would be with each style, and what the conclusion you would be looking
for is."
10810,A proof is a little like a kids-menu maze.

We will give three proofs, first a direct proof, then a proof by contrapositive, and
finally a proof by contradiction.
Proof."
10827,"Let be a sudoku puzzle with all different numbers in its corners: in the
top-left, in the top-right, in the bottom-left, and in the bottom-right."
10828,"Let be
any solution to the puzzle.
"
10829,"In , whatever digit is must appear in row 2."
10830,"Since is already in the top-left
box, it cannot appear in columns 1 or 2, so it must appear in columns 3 or 4."
10831,"If it is
in column 3, then appears in one of the center squares."
10832,"If not, then it is in column
4."
10833,"In this latter case, we ask where appears in row 3: It cannot be in column 1 or
4, so it must be in column 2 or 3, and thus in one of the center squares.
"
10834,"The same argument can now be applied to each of the other three outer squares.
"
10835,"Thus, in any solution to the puzzle, the center four squares must contain the digits
through , all different.
"
10836,"Now we will prove the same statement by contrapositive.
Proof."
10837,Let be a mini sudoku puzzle with numbers in its corners.
10838,"Let be any
solution to the puzzle."
10839,"Assume that the center four squares do not contain all
different numbers in . Then there must be some common number, say , in two
of the center squares.
"
10840,"Since cannot appear twice in a row, it must be that is in two center squares
diagonally from each other: either in r2c2 and r3c3, or in r2c3 and r3c2."
10841,"In either
case, where could be in rows 1 and 4?"
10842,"It cannot be in columns 2 or 3, so it must be
in columns 1 and 4."
10843,"This means that will be in opposite outer corners, meaning
that the digits in the four corners are not all different.
"
10844,"Finally, we will prove the same statement by contradiction.
Proof."
10845,"Let be a mini sudoku puzzle and assume that the four outer corners are
all different, but in some solution , the center four squares are not all different.
"
10846,"Suppose , the digit in the top-left corner, appears twice in the center four

10849,"But now, where can the fourth in the go in the solution?"
10850,"It must be in r4c4,
contradicting that the four corners are all different."

to a contradiction for each of the other possible outer corner digits being repeated
in the center."

"
11013,"So far we have seen how the logical form of a statement can inform how to build
the scaffolding of a proof."
11014,"This can only get us so far though: To flesh out the proof
skeleton requires an understanding of the mathematical objects and structures the
proofs are about."
11015,Some of this can come from carefully reading definitions.
11016,"Yet there
is also some less concrete understanding and intuition that comes from working
with the objects and structures that can lead to that ah-ha! moment of inspiration
that suggests how to proceed"
11017,By the way...
11018,Why are we writing proofs?

reasoners, diving into careful proofs about discrete structures is a way to learn
more about the structures themselves."
11020,"They are a playground for exploring
mathematics, to help us build intuition for mathematical structures."
11021,"So we
study structures to help us write proofs about them, and we write proofs
about them to help understand the structures."

Proofs about Sets
Recall that a set is an unordered collection of elements."
11050,"We can describe a set by
listing these elements, or by specifying a property that all elements in the set satisfy.

11051,"For example,
= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},

11052,"The second set here is the set of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, . . .)"
11053,less than 10.
11054,"Notice
that every element in is also an element of . Here is a definition that captures
that idea.
"
11055,"Definition 1.5.1
A set is a subset of a set , written , provided every element of is
also an element of .
The set is sometimes called a superset of .
"
11056,"We say is a proper subset of , written , provided and

11057,"In other words, if every element in is an element in , and there is
at least one element in that is not in .
Example 1.5.2
Let = {: < 5} and = {: 2 < 10}."
11058,"Is a proper
subset of ?
Solution.
"
11059,"We are asking whether every natural number less than 5 is also a
natural number whose square is less than 10."
11060,"Okay, we could just write out
the elements of the sets: = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and = {0, 1, 2, 3} (since 32 = 9
and 42 = 16)."
11061,"So . But , so in fact .
The sets in the example above were small, and it is easy enough to write down
the elements of the sets."
11062,"However, we can also prove subset relationships between
sets if this isnt practical or even possible (perhaps the sets are infinite)."
11063,"Lets look
carefully at how we could have reasoned about the example above.
"
11064,"We claimed that every element of was also an element of . Another way
to say this: For all numbers , if is an element of , then is also an element of
. Recognizing this as a conditional statement, we "

contrapositive, or contradiction proof of the fact."
11066,"Here a direct proof would be
perfectly acceptable."
11067,"Lets try it:
Proof."
11068,"Let be an element of the set . Then 2 < 10, by the definition of . Since
42 = 16, we must have that < 4."
11069,"By the definition of , and the fact that 4 < 5,
we see that .
To be clear, this proof is way more than we would normally do for this example,
but its format should be illuminating."
11070,"Proving that one set is a subset of another is
really the same as proving an implication!
"
11071,"To give an example of how we can apply the definition of subset in a more
general setting, lets prove a basic fact about subsets.
"
11072,"Proposition 1.5.3

know that . Therefore, .
Now lets prove a fact about numbers: Every multiple of 9100 is also a multiple
of 13."
11076,"We could factor 9100, but here is an easier way."
11077,"The set of multiples of 9100 is
a subset of the set of multiples of 91."
11078,"And the set of multiples of 91 is a subset of the
set of multiples of 13."
11079,"Now apply the proposition above.
"
11080,"The proof of Proposition 1.5.3 is what is sometimes called an element chasing
proof."
11081,"By the definition of subset, means every element of is an element of
, or equivalently, for all , if is an element of , then is an element of . One
way to prove this is to chase the element from to .
"
11082,We will write a direct proof.

lets do an element chasing proof for it.

Proofs about Functions
A function : is a rule that assigns each element of the set (the domain)

11109,Lets prove the following fact.
11110,"Recall that || denotes the cardinality (size) of
the set : the number of elements in .
Proposition 1.5.7
Suppose : is a function with and both finite sets."
11111,"If || > ||, then 
is not injective.
Proof."
11112,"We will give a proof of the contrapositive: If is injective, then || ||.
"
11113,"Let || = . Since is injective, each element of must be the output for at most
one element of ."
11114,"Thus there are at most elements in that get mapped to 
by ."
11115,"But the definition of a function requires that every element of the domain
is mapped to exactly one element of the codomain, so there must be at most 
elements in .
Does this proof remind you of our p"
11116,"It should, since this
is precisely (one of) the careful formulations of the pigeonhole principle."
11117,"We could
have proved the fact about students sharing a birth month, but now we can just
apply the proposition above and be done."
11118,"When you apply a theorem or proposition
to directly prove another result, we call the latter result a corollary.
"
11119,"Corollary 1.5.8
Suppose a class has 25 students."
11120,"Then at least two students share the same birth
month.
Proof."
11121,Consider the function that maps each student to their birth month.
11122,"Since
the domain has 25 elements and the codomain has 12 elements, the function is not
injective, by Proposition 1.5.7."
11123,"Therefore, at least two students share the same birth
month.
"
11124,"Functions always have inputs from a set (called the domain) and outputs in a set
as well (called the codomain)."
11125,"This naturally leads to facts to consider about the
interaction between sets and functions.
"
11126,"Definition 1.5.9
Given a function : and a set , we define the image of under
to be the set () = { () : }."
11127,"That is, () is the set of all outputs
of the function for inputs in .

Proofs about Relations
A relation on a set is a set of ordered pairs of elements from . We can think of
a relation as a way to describe a type of relationship between elements of . For
example, "
11146,"We might have a relation on the set of natural numbers that
describes which pairs of numbers are related by the relation < .
Relations permeate all of mathematics, often without us even thinking of th"
11147,"Whenever we make a statement about two elements of a set, we are implicitly
defining a relation."
11148,The statement is true when the pair is in the relation.
11149,"For
example, the statement, 3 is less than 5, is true because the pair (3, 5) is in the
relation <."
11150,"In fact, using the language we developed in the subsection Quantifiers
and Predicates, we can say that a relation is just a predicate, where the variables
come from the same set.
"
11151,Often relations have special symbols like = or  or .
11152,"When we talk about
a general relation, we will either use and write , or use a capital letter like ,
and write (, ) or or even (, ) (these all mean the same thing).
"
11153,"When we study relations, we try to identify properties that relations might have.
"
11154,"Here is an example of a very common property.

"
11155,"90
1. Logic and Proofs
Definition 1.5.12
A relation on a set is transitive provided for all , , , if and
, then .
Example 1.5.13
Consider the relation on the set of students in your Discrete Math cour"
11156,"Is
this relation transitive?
Solution.
"
11157,"No, not necessarily (although for some sets of students it could be).
"
11158,"For example, suppose Alice has another class with Bruce, say Introduction to
Programming."
11159,"Carlos is not in Intro to Programming, but he and Bruce are
both in Organic Chemistry."
11160,"So then AliceBruce and BruceCarlos, but it
might not be the case that AliceCarlos (since Alice need not be in Organic
Chemistry with Carlos).
"
11161,"Proving that a relation is not transitive takes nothing more than finding a
counterexample, which means finding three elements , , and such that ,
, but / (remember, the only way for an implication to"
11162,"Perhaps slightly more interesting would be proof that a relation is transitive.
"
11163,"Example 1.5.14
Consider the set of all students in your Discrete Mathematics class, and define
the relation that holds of students and (so is true), provided is
taller than . Prove that this relation "
11164,"The definition of transitive is an implication, so we can try a direct
proof.
Proof.
"
11165,"Let , , and be arbitrary students in your Discrete Math course.
"
11166,"Assume, and ."
11167,"That means that is taller than , and that is taller
than ."
11168,"But then surely must be even taller than than they are taller than ,
so we have that is true as well."
11169,"Thus is transitive on this set.
"
11170,"
1.5.5
Proofs about Graphs
We will spend all of Chapter 2 studying proofs about graphs since this is such a rich
area of mathematics."
11171,"As a preview, here is an example of how graph proofs can go.
"
11172,A graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges.
11173,"The edges are two-element
subsets of the vertices, and we can think of them as representing relationships
between the vertices."
11174,"Note, this is an abstract definition of a graph using sets, but
we often draw graphs using dots for the vertices connected by lines for the edges, as
this gives us a nice picture of what is going on.
"
11175,"Proofs about Discrete Structures
91
Since graphs represent a type of relationship between elements (vertices), we
can use graphs to represent many real-world problems."
11176,"For example, the vertices of
a graph might represent people at a party."
11177,"Each edge can represent a handshake
between two people."
11178,"So if we wondered whether it is possible for the 15 people at a
party to each shake hands with exactly 3 people there, we are really asking whether
there is a graph with 15 vertices where each vertex "
11179,"Yes, because an edge is a two-element subset of the vertices, so if an edge
touches or comes out of a vertex, that means the vertex belongs to that particular
two-element subset.)
"
11180,"Here is a definition related to this idea.
"
11181,"Definition 1.5.15
Let be a vertex in a graph ."
11182,"The degree of , written (), is the number of
edges that contain , i.e., the number of edges incident to .
Example 1.5.16
Consider the graph with vertices= {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1,"
11183,"What is the degree of each vertex in ?
Solution.
"
11184,"It might be helpful to picture the graph:
1
2
3
4
We have (1) = 3, (2)"
11185,"= 2, (3) = 2, and (4)"
11186,"You can see this by
counting how many edges are incident to each vertex, or by counting how
many edges (subsets) each vertex belongs to.
"
11187,"So is it possible for 15 people to each shake hands with exactly three people in
their group?"
11188,"Well, is there a graph with 15 vertices, all of degree 3?"
11189,"The answer is
no!
"
11190,"One way you can see this is if you ask how many edges such a graph would have.
"
11191,"Each vertex is incident to three edges, so counting incidences, we get 15  3 = 45."
11192,"But
every edge is incident to two vertices, so we have counted each edge twice."
11193,"So the
number of edges in such a graph would be 45/2"
11194,"But the number of edges in
a graph must be a whole number, so there is no such graph.
"
11195,"This suggests that we can say something more in general.
"
11196,"The following
proposition is a simple consequence of the Handshake Lemma 2.1.8, which we will
prove in Section 2.1."
11197,"Here we give a complete proof of this particular formulation of
it.

"
11198,"Logic and Proofs
Proposition 1.5.17
"
11199,"In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.
"
11200,We will prove this by contradiction.
11201,"Suppose there was a graph with an
odd number of vertices with odd degree."
11202,"Consider the sum of the degrees of all
the vertices."
11203,"The sum for the odd-degree vertices would be odd (since the sum of
an odd number of odd numbers is odd)."
11204,"The sum of the even-degree vertices will
be even (any sum of even numbers must be even)."
11205,"The sum of an odd number and
an even number is odd."
11206,"Thus the sum of all the degrees will be odd.
"
11207,"However, the number of edges in a graph is half the sum of the degrees (by
Lemma 2.1.8, or simply because each edge contributes one to the count of the
degree of two vertices)."
11208,"Since the number of edges is a whole number, we see
that the sum of the degrees must be even."
11209,"This contradicts what we found in the
previous paragraph.
"
11210,"Therefore, in any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.

Chapter Summary
We have considered logic both as its own sub-discipline of mathematics and as a
means to help us better understand and write proofs."
11266,"We noticed that mathematical
statements have a particular logical form, and analyzing that form can help make
sense of the statement.
"
11267,"At the most basic level, a statement might combine simpler statements using
logical connectives."
11268,"We often make use of variables and quantify over those variables.
"
11269,"How to resolve the truth or falsity of a statement based on these connectives and
quantifiers is what logic is all about."
11270,"From this, we can decide whether two statements
are logically equivalent or if one or more statements (logically) imply another.
"
11271,"When writing proofs (in any area of mathematics) our goal is to explain why
a mathematical statement is true."
11272,"Thus it is vital that our argument implies the
truth of the statement."
11273,"To be sure of this, we first must know what it means for the
statement to be true, as well as ensure that the statements that make up the proof
correctly imply the conclusion."
11274,"A firm understanding of logic is required to check
whether a proof is correct.
"
11275,"There is, however, another reason that understanding logic can be helpful.
"
11276,"Understanding the logical structure of a statement often gives clues for how to write
a proof of the statement.
"
11277,This is not to say that writing proofs is always straight-forward.
11278,"Consider again
the Goldbach conjecture:
"
11279,"Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two
primes.
"
11280,"We are not going to try to prove the statement here, but we can at least say what a
proof might look like, based on the logical form of the statement."
11281,"Perhaps we should
write the statement to highlight the quantifiers and connectives:
For all integers , if is even and greater than 2, then there exist integers
and such that and are prime, and = + .
"
11282,What would a direct proof look like?
11283,"Since the statement starts with a universal
quantifier, we would start, ``Let be an arbitrary integer."""
11284,"The rest of the statement
is an implication."
11285,"In a direct proof we assume the if part, so the next line would
be, Assume is greater than 2 and is even."
11286,"I have no idea what comes next, but
eventually, we would need to find two prime numbers and (depending on )
and explain how we know that = + .
"
11287,Or maybe we try a proof by contradiction.
11288,"To do this, we first assume the
negation of the statement we want to prove."
11289,What is the negation?
11290,"From what we
have studied we should be able to see that it is,
There is an integer such that is even and greater than 2, but for all
integers and , either or is not prime, or + .
Could this statement "
11291,"A proof by contradiction would start by assuming it
was and eventually conclude with a contradiction, proving that our assumption of

simple beauty and surprising depth."

be understood with almost no mathematical prerequisites, yet new research in the
subject generates hundreds of peer-reviewed research papers each year.

containing two islands."
11358,"The islands were connected to the banks of the river
by seven bridges (as seen below)."
11359,"The bridges were very beautiful, and on
their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges.
"
11360,"As time passed, a question arose: Was it possible to plan a walk so that
you cross each bridge once and only once?"
11361,"Euler was able to answer this
question."
11362,"Are you?
Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics, first studied by the super
famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735."
11363,"Since then it has blossomed into a
powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science and is currently an active area
of mathematics research.
"
11364,"The problem above, known as the Seven Bridges of Knigsberg, is the problem
that originally inspired graph theory."
11365,"Consider a different problem: Below is a
drawing of four dots connected by some lines."
11366,"Is it possible to trace over each line
once and only once (without lifting your pencil, starting and ending on a dot)?
"
11367,There is an obvious connection between these two problems.
11368,"Any path in the
dot and line drawing corresponds exactly to a path over the bridges of Knigsberg.
"
11369,"Pictures like this dot and line drawing are called graphs (although technically,
the picture above is a multigraph)."
11370,"Graphs are made up of a collection of dots
called vertices and lines connecting those dots called edges."
11371,"When two vertices
are connected by an edge, we say they are adjacent."
11372,"The nice thing about looking
at graphs instead of pictures of rivers, islands, and bridges is that we now have a
mathematical object to study."

11375,"It does not matter how big the islands are, what the bridges
are made out of, if the river contains alligators, etc."
11376,"All that matters is which land
masses are connected to which other land masses, and how many times."
11377,"This was
the great insight Euler had.
"
11378,We will return to the question of finding paths through graphs in Section 2.4.
11379,"In
this section, we will explore various ways that graphs can be used to represent, or
model, real-world problems."
11380,"Along the way, we will introduce some basic definitions,
terminology, and notation that will be used in the rest of the chapter.

11383,"The graph 4 is presented as an adjacency
matrix where the rows and columns correspond to the vertices and the entries are 1
if the vertices are adjacent and 0 otherwise."
11384,"Before answering the questions below, it
might be helpful to draw a more traditional representation of these graphs.
"
11385,"1.
First, lets count the number of vertices and edges in each graph.
"
11386,"We call the number of edges incident to a particular vertex (i.e., the number of
edges coming out of the vertex) the degree of the vertex."
11387,"A list of the degrees
of all the vertices in non-increasing order is called a degree sequence for the
graph."
11388,"Find the degree sequence for each graph.

"
11390,We often care about paths between vertices in a graph.
11391,"A graph is connected
if there is a path between every pair of vertices."
11392,"Sometimes there is a path that
starts at a vertex and eventually comes back to itself, which is called a cycle.
"
11393,"(a) Which of the graphs are connected?
(b) Which of the graphs contain cycles?
(c) Graphs that are connected and contain no cycles are called trees."
11394,"For
each graph, how many edges must you remove to turn it into a tree?"
11395,"(If it
is already a tree, the answer would be 0.)
"
11396,"4.
For which of the graphs is it possible to draw the graph in such a way that no
edges cross?
5.
"
11397,"Suppose we color each vertex of a graph so that adjacent vertices always have
different colors."
11398,"The smallest number of colors needed to do this is called the
chromatic number of the graph."
11399,"Find the chromatic number for each graph.
"
11400,"Note: If the graphs represented friendships between people, then the
chromatic number would tell us the minimum number of groups we would
need if we wanted to divide up everyone into groups of people "
11401,"2.1.2
What is a Graph?
Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is."
11402,"While we
almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines), this is fairly
ambiguous."
11403,Do the lines need to be straight?
11404,"Does it matter how long the lines are
or how large the dots are?"
11405,"Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?
"
11406,"Can one line connect three dots?
"
11407,"The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous
definitions."
11408,"Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important."
11409,"The
definition is the agreed-upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics
proceed."
11410,Is there a graph with no edges?
11411,"We have to look at the definition to see if
this is possible.
"
11412,"We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree
with our intuition for the objects we are studying."
11413,"It needs to be useful: We could
define a graph to be a six-legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any
problems about bridges."
11414,"Instead, here is the (now) standard definition of a graph.
"
11415,"Definition 2.1.1 Graph.
"
11416,"A graph is an ordered pair = (, ) consisting of a nonempty set (called
the vertices) and a set (called the edges) of two-element subsets of .
Strange."
11417,Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines.
11418,"From the

2.1."
11419,"Problems and Definitions
103
definition, a graph could be
({, , , }, {{, }, {, }, {, }, {, }, {, }}).
"
11420,"Here we have a graph with four vertices (the letters , , , ) and five edges (the
pairs {, }, {, }, {, }, {, }, {, })).
"
11421,Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process.
11422,"That is why
we often draw a representation of these sets."
11423,"We put a dot down for each vertex,
and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the
2-element subsets in our set of edges."
11424,"Thus one way to draw the graph described
above is this:




"
11425,However we could also have drawn the graph differently.
11426,"For example either of
these:








We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be the same.
"
11427,"Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?"
11428,"Are the edge
sets equal?"
11429,"We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but
a pair of two special sorts of sets.
"
11430,"Example 2.1.2
Are the graphs below equal?
"
11431,"1 = ({, , }, {{, }, {, }});
2 = ({, , }, {{, }, {, }}).
"
11432,"Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a
good start."
11433,"Also, both graphs have two edges."
11434,"In the first graph, we have
edges {, } and {, }, while in the second graph we have edges {, } and
{, }."
11435,"Of course, {, } = {, }, so that is not the problem."
11436,"The issue is that
{, } {, }."
11437,"Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets),
the graphs are not equal (as graphs).
"
11438,"Even if two graphs are not equal, they might be basically the same."
11439,"The graphs in
the previous example could be drawn like this:

Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called isomorphic.
"
11441,"We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick example:
Example 2.1.3
Consider the graphs:
1 = (1, 1) where 1 = {, , } and 1 = {{, }, {, }, {, }};
2 = (2, 2) where 2 = {, , } and 2 = {{,"
11442,"Are these graphs the same?

"
11443,The two graphs are NOT equal.
11444,"It is enough to notice that 1 2
since 1 but 2."
11445,"However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices
with edges connecting every pair of vertices."
11446,"We can draw them as follows:






Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so while they
are not equal, they will be isomorphic."
11447,"We can rename the vertices of one
graph and get the second graph as the result.
"
11448,"Intuitively, graphs are isomorphic if they are basically the same, or better yet,
if they are the same except for the names of the vertices."
11449,"To make the concept of
renaming vertices precise, we give the following definitions:

11450,Two graphs are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them.
11451,"In
this case we write 1  2.
"
11452,An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices.
11453,"It must be
a bection so every vertex gets a new name."
11454,"These newly named vertices must be
connected by edges precisely when they were connected by edges with their old
names.

Example 2.1.5

However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and the

11459,"How about we say () = , () = ,

11460,"This is definitely a bection, but to make sure that the
function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it respects the edge relation."
11461,"In
1, vertices and are connected by an edge."
11462,"In 2, () = and () =

11463,"So far, so good, but we must check the other three
edges."
11464,"The edge {, } in 1 corresponds to { (), ()} = {, }, but here we
have a problem."
11465,There is no edge between and in 2.
11466,"Thus is NOT an
isomorphism.
"
11467,"Not all hope is lost, however."
11468,"Just because is not an isomorphism does
not mean that there is no isomorphism at all."
11469,We can try again.
11470,"At this point
it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.

Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like or the Petersen
graph) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels."
11485,"In this case, we are really
referring to all graphs isomorphic to any copy of that particular graph."

of isomorphic graphs is often called an isomorphism class.1
There are other relationships between graphs that we care about, other than
equality and being isomorphic."

11488,We should give a careful definition of this.
11489,"In fact, there are two reasonable
notions for what a subgraph should mean.

"
11491,"We say that  = (, ) is a subgraph of = (, ), and write  ,
provided  and  .
We say that  = (, ) is an induced subgraph of = (, ) provided
 and every edge in whose vertices are still in  is also an edge"
11492,"Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges
from the larger graph."
11493,"For the subgraph to be an induced subgraph, we can still
delete vertices, but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.
"
11494,"1This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular triangle.

11495,"There instead of isomorphic we say congruent.

Example 2.1.7

11497,"But only 2 is an induced
subgraph."
11498,"Every edge in 1 that connects vertices in 2 is also an edge in 2.
"
11499,"In 3, the edge {, } is in 1 but not 3, even though vertices and are in
3.
"
11500,"The graph 4 is NOT a subgraph of 1, even though it looks like all we
did is remove vertex ."
11501,"The reason is that in 4 we have the edge {, }, but
this is not an element of 1, so we dont have the required 4 1.
"
11502,Back to some basic graph theory definitions.
11503,"Notice that all the graphs we have
drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once,
and no vertex is connected to itself."
11504,"Graphs like these are sometimes called simple,
although we will just call them graphs."
11505,"This is because our definition of a graph
says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices."
11506,"Remember that it
doesnt make sense to say a set contains an element more than once."
11507,"So no pair of
vertices can be connected by an edge more than once."
11508,"Also, since each edge must be
a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by
an edge.
"
11509,"That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single-
edge loops."
11510,"For example, the graph we drew for the Bridges of Knigsberg problem
had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island
to the near shore."
11511,We will call these objects multigraphs.
11512,"This is a good name: A
multiset is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.
"
11513,"The graphs above are also connected: you can get from any vertex to any other
vertex by following some path of edges."
11514,"A graph that is not connected can be
thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together."
11515,"For example, the following
graph is NOT connected because there is no path from to :


Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them."

edges, then the resulting graph is called complete."
11517,"That is, a graph is complete

11518,"Graph Theory
if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge."
11519,"Since a graph is determined
completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one
complete graph with a given number of vertices."
11520,"We give these a special name: 
is the complete graph on vertices.
"
11521,Each vertex in is adjacent to 1 other vertices.
11522,"We call the number of edges
emanating from a given vertex the degree of that vertex."
11523,"So every vertex in has
degree 1."
11524,How many edges does have?
11525,"One might think the answer should
be (1), since we count 1 edges times (once for each vertex)."
11526,"However, each
edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice."
11527,"Thus there
are (1)/2 edges in ."
11528,"Alternatively, we can say there are  
2
 edges, since to
draw an edge we must choose 2 of the vertices.
"
11529,"In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the
number of edges."
11530,"The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be twice the
number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices."
11531,"Notice this
means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!
"
11532,This is our first example of a general result about all graphs.
11533,"It seems innocent
enough, but we will use it to prove all sorts of other statements."
11534,"So lets give it a
name and state it formally.
"
11535,"Lemma 2.1.8 Handshake Lemma.
"
11536,"In any graph, the sum of the degrees of vertices in the graph is always twice the
number of edges.
"
11537,"The handshake lemma2 is sometimes called the degree sum formula, and can be
written symbolically as


()"
11538,"Here we are using the notation () for the degree of the vertex .
One use for the lemma is to actually find the number of edges in a graph."
11539,"To
do this, you must be given the degree sequence for the graph (or be able to find it
from other information)."
11540,"This is a list of every degree of every vertex in the graph,
generally written in non-increasing order.
"
11541,"Example 2.1.9
How many vertices and edges must a graph have if its degree sequence is
(4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1)?
"
11542,The number of vertices is easy to find.
11543,"It is the number of degrees
in the sequence: 7. To find the number of edges, we compute the degree sum
4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 20,

11544,"Problems and Definitions
109
so the number of edges is half this: 10.
"
11545,"The handshake lemma also tells us what is not possible.
"
11546,"Example 2.1.10
At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking
hands."
11547,"Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7
people at the seminar?
Solution.
"
11548,It seems like this should be possible.
11549,"Each mathematician chooses
one person to not shake hands with."
11550,But this cannot happen.
11551,"We are asking
whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7."
11552,"If such a
graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be 9  7 = 63."
11553,"This
would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with
31.5 edges."
11554,That is impossible.
11555,"Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of
the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an even number of people
at the seminar.
"
11556,"We can generalize the previous example to get the following proposition.3
Proposition 2.1.11
In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.
"
11557,"Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with odd
degree.
"
11558,"Then the sum of the degrees in the graph would be odd, which is
impossible, by the handshake lemma.
"
11559,"We will consider further applications of the handshake lemma in the exercises.

11560,"One final definition: We say a graph is bipartite if the vertices can be divided
into two sets, and , with no two vertices in adjacent and no two vertices in

11697,"If
you trace the tree back from you to that common ancestor, then down through your

"
11698,"You might also have seen something called a decision tree (such as the algorithm
for deciding whether a series converges or diverges)."
11699,"Sometimes these too contain
cycles, as the decision for one node might lead you back to a previous step.
"
11700,"Both the examples of trees above also have another feature worth mentioning:
There is a clear order to the vertices in the tree."
11701,"The definition of a tree does not
include this added structure, although we can impose such a structure by considering
rooted trees, where we simply designate one vertex as the root."
11702,"We will consider
such trees in more detail later in this section.
"
11703,"In this section, we will explore some basic properties of trees, which will serve
as an excellent introduction to writing proofs about graphs."

Properties of Trees
We wish to really understand trees."
11715,"This means we should discover properties of
trees: what makes them special and what is special about them.
"
11716,A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.
11717,"Is there anything else we can say?
"
11718,It would be nice to have other equivalent conditions for a graph to be a tree.
11719,"That
is, we would like to know whether there are any graph theoretic properties that all
trees have, and perhaps even that only trees have.
"
11720,"To get a feel for the sorts of things we can say, we will consider three propositions
about trees."
11721,"These will also illustrate important proof techniques that apply to
graphs in general, and happen to be a little easier for trees.
"
11722,Our first proposition gives an alternate definition for a tree.
11723,"That is, it gives
necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a tree.
"
11724,"A graph is a tree if and only if between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a
unique path.
"
11725,"This is an if and only if statement, so we must prove two implications.
"
11726,"We start by proving that if is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices
there is a unique path.
"
11727,"Assume is a tree, and let and be distinct vertices (if only has one vertex,
then the conclusion is satisfied automatically)."
11728,"We must show two things to show
that there is a unique path between and : that there is a path, and that there
is not more than one path."
11729,"The first of these is automatic; since is a tree, it is
connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.
"
11730,"To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between and ,
and get a contradiction."
11731,"The two paths might start out the same, but since they are
different, there is some first vertex  after which the two paths diverge."
11732,"However,
since the two paths both end at , there is some first vertex after  that they have

11733,"Graph Theory
in common, call it . Now consider the two paths from  to . Taken together,
these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that is a tree.
"
11734,"Now we consider the converse: If between every pair of distinct vertices of 
there is a unique path, then is a tree."
11735,"So assume the hypothesis: Between every
pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path."
11736,"To prove that is a tree, we
must show it is connected and contains no cycles.
"
11737,"The first half of this is easy: is connected, because there is a path between
every pair of vertices."
11738,"To show that has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake
of contradiction."
11739,"Let and be two distinct vertices in a cycle of . Since we can
get from to by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are
two paths from and , contradicting our assumption.
"
11740,"We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.
"
11741,Read the proof above very carefully.
11742,"Notice that both directions had two parts:
the existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which related to the fact that
there were no cycles)."
11743,"In this case, these two parts were really separate."
11744,"In fact, if we
just considered graphs with no cycles (a forest), then we could still do the parts of
the proof that explore the uniqueness of paths between vertices, even if there might
not exist path"
11745,"This observation allows us to state the following corollary.5
Corollary 2.2.3
A graph is a forest if and only if between any pair of vertices in there is at most
one path.
"
11746,"We do not give a proof of the corollary (it is, after all, supposed to follow directly
from the proposition), but for practice, you are asked to give a careful proof in the
exercises."
11747,"When you do so, try to use proof by contrapositive instead of proof by
contradiction.
"
11748,"Our second proposition tells us that all trees have leaves: vertices of degree one.
"
11749,"Proposition 2.2.4
Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two vertices of degree one.
Proof."
11750,We give a proof by contradiction.
11751,"Let be a tree with at least two vertices,
and suppose, contrary to stipulation, that there are not two vertices of degree one.
"
11752,Let be a path in of longest possible length.
11753,"Let and be the endpoints of
the path."
11754,"Since does not have two vertices of degree one, at least one of these
must have degree two or higher."
11755,Say that it is .
11756,"We know that is adjacent to a
vertex in the path , but now it must also be adjacent to another vertex, call it .
Where is ?"
11757,"It cannot be a vertex of , because if it was, there would be two
distinct paths from to : the edge between them, and the first part of (up to
5A corollary is another sort of provable statement, like a"
11758,"Trees
121
)."
11759,"But  also cannot be outside of , for if it was, there would be a path from 
to that was longer than , which has the longest possible length.
"
11760,"This contradiction proves that there must be at least two vertices of degree one.
"
11761,"In fact, we can say a little more: and must both have degree one.
"
11762,"The proposition is quite useful when proving statements about trees, because
we often prove statements about trees by induction."
11763,"This is a proof technique that
we investigate fully in Section 4.5, but for now, all we need to understand is that it is
useful to compare a given tree to smaller trees."
11764,"To show something is true of a tree
with vertices, we will assume the thing is true of all trees with 1 vertices."
11765,"By
removing a vertex of degree 1, we get this smaller tree, and then we just need to
show that putting the vertex back doesnt mess us up.
"
11766,Is there a tree with exactly 7 vertices and 7 edges?
11767,Try to draw one.
11768,"Could a tree
with 7 vertices have only 5 edges?"
11769,"There is a good reason that these seem impossible
to draw.
"
11770,"Proposition 2.2.5
Let be a tree with vertices and edges."
11771,"Then = 1.
"
11772,We will prove that this proposition is true for all possible values of 1.
11773,"Note
that if = 1, then the tree must have 0 edges, so yes, = 1."
11774,"We could then look
at trees with = 2 vertices (there is only one, and it has = 1 = 1 edges) and
then all trees with = 3 vertices, and then = 4, and so on, but that would take
forever."
11775,"Instead, we will do a version of proof by contradiction called the minimal criminal.
"
11776,"We will assume the proposition is not true (just like we would start any proof by
contradiction)."
11777,"This means that there is some smallest tree for which it isnt true.
"
11778,"If this smallest counterexample (i.e., minimal criminal) has vertices, then we are
guaranteed that all trees with 1 vertices are not counterexamples."
11779,"Lets see how
this works out.
"
11780,"Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the proposition is not true for
all trees."
11781,"Let be a tree for which the proposition is not true, with the smallest
number of vertices among all the counterexamples."
11782,"Let be the number of vertices
of .
"
11783,"Since the only tree with one vertex has zero edges, that cannot be our tree ,
so we can assume 2."
11784,"In particular, we know by Proposition 2.2.4 that must
contain at least one vertex of degree 1, call it 0.
"
11785,"Let  be the tree resulting from removing 0 from (together with its incident
edge)."
11786,"Since we removed a leaf,  is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of
vertices in  are the same as the unique paths between them in ).
"
11787,Now  has 1 vertices.
11788,"Since was the smallest tree for which the proposition
isnt true, we know that the proposition is true for ."
11789,"So  must have one fewer
edges than vertices; that is,  has 2 edges."

so it has 1 edges."

proposition, which completes our proof.
"
11793,"2.2.3
Spanning Trees
One of the advantages of trees is that they give us a few simple ways to travel
through the vertices."
11794,"If a connected graph is not a tree, then we can still use these
traversal algorithms if we identify a subgraph that is a tree.
"
11795,First we should consider if this even makes sense.
11796,"Given any connected graph ,
will there always be a subgraph that is a tree?"
11797,"Well, that is actually too easy: You
could just take a single vertex of . If we want to use this subgraph to tell us how to
visit all vertices, then we want our subgraph to include all of the vertices"
11798,"We call
such a tree a spanning tree.
"
11799,"Definition 2.2.6
Given a connected graph , a spanning tree of is a subgraph of which is
a tree and includes all the vertices of .
"
11800,"It turns out that every connected graph has one (and usually many).
"
11801,"Theorem 2.2.7
Every connected graph has a spanning tree.
"
11802,How do we know?
11803,We can give an algorithm for finding a spanning tree!
11804,"Start
with a connected graph ."
11805,"If there is no cycle, then is already a tree and we are
done."
11806,"If there is a cycle, let be any edge in that cycle and consider the new graph
1 = (i.e., the graph you get by deleting )."
11807,"This tree is still connected: Since 
belonged to a cycle, there were at least two paths between its incident vertices."
11808,"Now
repeat: If 1 has no cycles, we are done; otherwise define 2 to be 1 1, where 1
is an edge in a cycle in 1."
11809,"This process must eventually stop, since
there are only a finite number of edges to remove."
11810,"The result will be a tree, and since
we never removed any vertex, a spanning tree.
"
11811,This is by no means the only algorithm for finding a spanning tree.
11812,"You could
have started with the empty graph and added edges that belong to , as long as
adding them would not create a cycle."
11813,"You have some choices as to which edges you
add first: You could always add an edge adjacent to edges you have already added
(after the first one, of course), or add them using some other order."
11814,"Which spanning
tree you end up with depends on these choices.

"
11817,"Here are two spanning trees.
"
11818,"Although we will not consider this in detail, these algorithms are usually applied
to weighted graphs."
11819,Here every edge has some weight or cost assigned to it.
11820,"The goal
is to find a spanning tree that has the smallest possible combined weight."
11821,"Such a
tree is called a minimum spanning tree."
11822,"Finding the minimum spanning tree uses
basically the same algorithms as we described above, but when picking an edge to
add, you always pick the smallest (or when removing an edge, you always remove

11823,"However, it is
often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve problems."
11824,"Data is often
structured like a tree."
11825,"This book, for example, has a tree structure:"
11826,"Draw a vertex for
the book itself."
11827,"Then draw vertices for each chapter, connected to the book vertex.
"
11828,"Under each chapter, draw a vertex for each section, connecting it to the chapter it
belongs to."
11829,"The graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree, but a tree with a clear
hierarchy which is not present if we dont identify the book vertex as the top.
"
11830,"As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the root, then every other vertex
on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root."
11831,"This works
because there is a unique path between any two vertices in a tree."
11832,"So from any vertex,
we can travel back to the root in exactly one way."
11833,"This also allows us to describe how
distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.
"
11834,"If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the parent of the other,
which is called the child of the parent."
11835,"Of the two, the parent is the vertex that is
closer to the root."
11836,"Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but is not the child of any vertex
(and is unique in this respect: All non-root vertices have exactly one parent).

the vertex (and it is the grandparent)."

For most trees (in fact, all except paths with one end the root), there will be pairs
of vertices neither of which is a descendant of the other."
11843,"We might call these cousins
or siblings."
11844,"In fact, vertices and are called siblings provided they have the same
parent."
11845,"Note that siblings are never adjacent (do you see why?).
"
11846,"Example 2.2.9
Consider the tree below.
"
11847,"








If we designate vertex as the root, then , , and are the children of ,
and are siblings of each other."
11848,"Among the other things we cay say are that 
is a child of , and a descendant of . The vertex is a descendant of , in

11849,Notice how this changes if we pick a different vertex for the root.

the root, then its lone child is , which also has only one child, namely . We
would then have the child of (instead of the other way around), and is
the descendant of , instead of the ancestor."
11851,"and are now siblings.
"
11852,"All of this flowery language helps us describe how to navigate through a tree.
"
11853,"Traversing a tree, visiting each vertex in some order, is a key step in many algorithms.
"
11854,"Even if the tree is not rooted, we can always form a rooted tree by picking any vertex
as the root."
11855,"Here is an example of why doing so can be helpful.
"
11856,"Example 2.2.10
Explain why every tree is a bipartite graph.
Solution.
"
11857,"To show that a graph is bipartite, we must divide the vertices into
two sets, and , so that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent."
11858,"Here is
an algorithm that does just this.
"
11859,Designate any vertex as the root.
11860,Put this vertex in set .
11861,"Now put all of
the children of the root in set . None of these children are adjacent (they are
siblings), so we are good so far."
11862,"Now put into every child of every vertex
in (i.e."
11863,", every grandchild of the root)."
11864,"Keep going until all vertices have
been assigned one of the sets, alternating between and every generation.
"
11865,"That is, a vertex is in set if and only if it is the child of a vertex in set .

2.2."
11866,"Trees
125
The key to how we partitioned the tree in the example was to know which vertex
to assign to a set next."
11867,"We chose to visit all vertices in the same generation before
any vertices of the next generation."
11868,"This is usually called a breadth-first search
(we say search because you often traverse a tree looking for vertices with certain
properties).
"
11869,"In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order."
11870,"Start
with the root; put it in ."
11871,"Then look for one child of the root to put in . Then find a
child of that vertex, into , and then find its child, into , and so on."
11872,"When you get
to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent, and see if the parent has any other
children."
11873,"So we travel as far from the root as fast as possible, then backtrack until we
can move forward again."
11874,"This is called depth-first search.
"
11875,"These algorithmic explanations can serve as a proof that every tree is bipartite,
although care needs to be spent to prove that the algorithms are correct."
11876,"Another
approach to prove that all trees are bipartite, using induction, is requested in the

"
11958,"When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is
called planar."
11959,"When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the
plane into regions called faces.
"
11960,"Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number
of vertices, edges, and faces.
"
11961,"Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number
of vertices and edges, but a different number of faces.
"
11962,When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross?
11963,"If this is
possible, we say the graph is planar (since you can draw it on the plane).
"
11964,Notice that the definition of planar includes the phrase it is possible to.
11965,"This
means that even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still might be."
11966,"Perhaps
you can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross."
11967,"For example, this is a planar
graph:
That is because we can redraw it like this:

130
2."
11968,"The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be, too."
11969,"However, the
original drawing of the graph was not a planar representation of the graph.
"
11970,"When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges and vertices of
the graph divide the plane into regions."
11971,We will call each region a face.
11972,"The graph
above has 3 faces (yes, we do include the outside region as a face)."
11973,"The number
of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so
without the edges crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a
property of the planar gra"
11974,": you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way.
"
11975,"For example, consider these two representations of the same graph:
If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say there are 5
faces (including the outside)."
11976,"But drawing the graph with a planar representation
shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.

Eulers Formula for Planar Graphs
There is a connection between the number of"
11995,"This relationship is
called Eulers formula.
"
11996,"Eulers Formula for Planar Graphs.
"
11997,"For any connected planar graph with vertices, edges, and faces, we
have
+ = 2.
"
11998,Why is Eulers formula true?
11999,"One way to convince ourselves of its validity is to
draw a planar graph step by step."
12000,"Start with the graph 2:
Any connected graph (besides just a single isolated vertex) must contain this
subgraph."
12001,Now we build up to our graph by adding edges and vertices.
12002,"Each step
will consist of either adding a new vertex connected by a new edge to part of your
graph (so creating a new spike) or by connecting two vertices already in the graph

2."
12003,"Graph Theory
with a new edge (completing a circuit).
"
12004,What do these moves do?
12005,"When adding the spike, the number of edges
increases by 1, the number of vertices increases by 1, and the number of faces
remains the same."
12006,But this means that + does not change.
12007,"Completing a
circuit adds one edge, adds one face, and keeps the number of vertices the same."
12008,"So
again, + does not change.
"
12009,"Since we can build any graph using a combination of these two moves, and doing
so never changes the quantity + , that quantity will be the same for all graphs.
"
12010,"But notice that our starting graph 2 has = 2, = 1, and = 1, so + = 2.
"
12011,"The argument we have outlined above is not quite correct, since we made the
unjustified assumption that all graphs can be built up from 2 using only the two
moves we described."
12012,"To avoid this issue, we can use a minimal criminal argument.

12013,"You are asked to do this in the exercises, but the idea is essentially the same as we
have here, except that we start with a minimal connected planar graph that does
not satisfy the formula, then remo"
12014,"But just like the
adding moves we have described above, removing an edge or a vertex does not
change the quantity + .

Non-planar Graphs
Investigate!
"
12015,"For the complete graphs , we would like to be able to say something
about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph is planar) faces."
12016,"Lets
first consider 3:
"
12017,How many vertices does 3 have?
12018,"How many edges?
2."
12019,"If 3 is planar, how many faces should it have?

some of the edges will need to intersect."
12027,"The smallest graph where this happens is
5.
"
12028,"If you try to redraw this without edges crossing, you quickly get into trouble.
"
12029,There seems to be one edge too many.
12030,"In fact, we can prove that no matter how you
draw it, 5 will always have edges crossing.
"
12031,"Theorem 2.3.1
5 is not planar.
Proof."
12032,The proof is by contradiction.
12033,So assume that 5 is planar.
12034,"Then the graph
must satisfy Eulers formula for planar graphs."
12035,"5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges, so
we get
5 10 + = 2,
which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing, there would be
= 7 faces.
"
12036,"Now consider how many edges surround each face.
"
12037,"Each face must be
surrounded by at least 3 edges."
12038,"Let be the total number of boundaries around all
the faces in the graph."
12039,Thus we have that 3.
12040,"But also = 2, since each edge
is used as a boundary exactly twice."
12041,"Putting this together we get
3 2.
But this is impossible, since we have already determined that = 7 and = 10,
and 21 20."
12042,"This is a contradiction, so in fact 5 is not planar.
"
12043,"The other simplest graph which is not planar is 3,3
Proving that 3,3 is not planar answers the classic houses and utilities puzzle: it
is not possible to connect each of three houses to each of three "
12044,"Theorem 2.3.2
3,3 is not planar.

134
2."
12045,"Graph Theory
Proof."
12046,"Again, we proceed by contradiction."
12047,"Suppose 3,3 were planar."
12048,"Then by
Eulers formula, there will be 5 faces, since = 6, = 9, and 6 9 + = 2.
How many boundaries surround these 5 faces?"
12049,Let be this number.
12050,"Since
each edge is used as a boundary twice, we have = 2. Also, 4 since each
face is surrounded by 4 or more boundaries."
12051,"We know this is true because 3,3 is
bipartite, so does not contain any 3-edge cycles."
12052,"Thus
4 2.
But this would say that 20 18, which is clearly false."
12053,"Thus 3,3 is not planar.
"
12054,Note the similarities and differences in these proofs.
12055,"Both are proofs by contra-
diction, and both start with using Eulers formula to derive the (supposed) number
of faces in the graph."
12056,"Then we find a relationship between the number of faces and
the number of edges based on how many edges surround each face."
12057,"This is the only
difference."
12058,"In the proof for 5, we got 32and for 3,3 we had 42. The
coefficient of is the key."
12059,"It is the smallest number of edges that could surround any
face."
12060,"If some number of edges surround a face, then these edges form a cycle."
12061,"So
that number is the size of the smallest cycle in the graph.
"
12062,"In general, if we let be the size of the smallest cycle in a graph (stands for
girth, which is the technical term for this) then for any planar graph we have 2.
When this disagrees with Eulers formula"

Polyhedra
Investigate!
"
12064,A cube is an example of a convex polyhedron.
12065,"It contains 6 identical squares
for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges."
12066,"The cube is a regular polyhedron (also
known as a Platonic solid) because each face is an identical regular polygon
and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.
"
12067,"There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahe-
dron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron, with 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces respectively.
"
12068,"How many vertices and edges do each of these have?
"
12069,"Another area of mathematics where you might have heard the terms vertex,
edge, and face is geometry."
12070,"A polyhedron is a geometric solid made up of flat
polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices."
12071,"We are especially interested in convex
polyhedra, which means that any line segment connecting two points on the interior
of the polyhedron must be entirely contained inside the polyhedron.7

12072,This is not a coincidence.

12075,"One
such projection looks like this:
In fact, every convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges
crossing."
12076,"Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center
of the sphere."
12077,"The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the
interior of the sphere."
12078,"You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of
the projected faces and stretch the sphere to lie down flat on the plane."
12079,"The face
that was punctured becomes the outside face of the planar graph.
"
12080,"The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar
graphs) to convex polyhedra."
12081,"Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as
a planar graph, we see that Eulers formula for planar graphs holds for all convex
polyhedra as well."
12082,"We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs
in other contexts to convex polyhedra."
12083,"For example, we know that there is no convex
polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33/2 edges.
"
12084,"Example 2.3.3
Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six pentagons?
"
12085,"What about three triangles, six pentagons, and five heptagons (7-sided
polygons)?
"
12086,How many edges would such polyhedra have?
12087,"For the first
proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total of 9 edges, and
the pentagons would contribute 30."
12088,"However, this counts each edge twice
(as each edge borders exactly two faces), giving 39/2 edges, an impossibility.
"
12089,"There is no such polyhedron.
"
12090,The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle.
12091,"The extra 35 edges
contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74/2 = 37 edges."
12092,"So far so good.
"
12093,Now how many vertices does this supposed polyhedron have?
12094,"We can use
Eulers formula."
12095,"There are 14 faces, so we have 37 + 14 = 2 or equivalently
= 25."
12096,But now use the vertices to count the edges again.
12097,"Each vertex must
have degree at least three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since
the interior angle of all the polygons must be less that 180), so the sum of the
degrees of vertices "
12098,"Since the sum of the degrees must be exactly
twice the number of edges, this says that there are strictly more than 37 edges.
"
12099,"Again, there is no such polyhedron.
"
12100,"To conclude this application of planar graphs, consider the regular polyhedra.

"
12101,We claimed there are only five.
12102,How do we know this is true?
12103,"We can prove it using
graph theory.
"
12104,"Theorem 2.3.4
There are exactly five regular polyhedra.
Proof.
"
12105,"Recall that all the faces of a regular polyhedron are identical regular
polygons and that each vertex has the same degree."
12106,"Consider four cases, depending
on the type of regular polygon.
"
12107,Case 1: Each face is a triangle.
12108,Let be the number of faces.
12109,"There are then
3/2 edges."
12110,"Using Eulers formula, we have 3 /2 + = 2 so = 2 + /2.
"
12111,"Now each vertex has the same degree, say ."
12112,"So the number of edges is also /2.
"
12113,"Putting this together gives
= 3 
2 = (2 + /2)
2
,
which says
=
6
4 + .
Both and must be positive integers."
12114,"Note that
6
4+is an increasing function
for positive , bounded above by a horizontal asymptote at = 6."
12115,"Thus the only
possible values for are 3, 4, and 5."
12116,Each of these is possible.
12117,"To get = 3, we need
= 4 (this is the tetrahedron)."
12118,For = 4 we take = 8 (the octahedron).
12119,"For = 5
take = 20 (the icosahedron)."
12120,"Thus there are exactly three regular polyhedra with
triangles for faces.
"
12121,Case 2: Each face is a square.
12122,"Now we have = 4 /2 = 2. Using Eulers
formula, we get = 2 + , and counting edges using the degree of each vertex
gives us
= 2 = (2 + )
2
.
"
12123,"Solving for gives
=
4 
2 + =
8
4 + 2 .
"
12124,"This is again an increasing function, but this time the horizontal asymptote is
at = 4, so the only possible value that could take is 3."
12125,"This produces 6 faces,
and we have a cube."
12126,"There is only one regular polyhedron with square faces.
"
12127,Case 3: Each face is a pentagon.
12128,"We perform the same calculation as above,
this time getting = 5 /2 so = 2 + 3 /2."
12129,"Then
= 5
2 = (2 + 3 /2)
2
,
so
=
10 
4 + 3 .

2.3."
12130,"Planar Graphs
137
Now the horizontal asymptote is at 10
3 ."
12131,"This is less than 4, so we can only hope
to have = 3."
12132,"We can do so by using 12 pentagons, getting the dodecahedron.
"
12133,"This is the only regular polyhedron with pentagons as faces.
"
12134,Case 4: Each face is an -gon with 6.
12135,"Following the same procedure as
above, we deduce that
=
2
4 + (2) ,
which will be increasing to a horizontal asymptote of
2
2."
12136,"When = 6, this
asymptote is at = 3."
12137,"Any larger value of will give an even smaller asymptote.
"
12138,"Therefore no regular polyhedra exist with faces larger than pentagons.a

"
12201,"A spider is standing on one face of an octahedron (a polyhedron with eight
triangular faces)."
12202,"She wants to crawl along the solid from face to face so that
she crosses each edge exactly once."
12203,Is this possible?
12204,"If so, how?
"
12205,"If we start at a vertex and trace along edges to get to other vertices, we create a
walk through the graph."
12206,"More precisely, a walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices
such that every vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertices before and after it
in the sequence."
12207,"If the walk travels along every edge exactly once, then the walk is
called an Euler trail (or Euler walk or Euler path)."
12208,"If, in addition, the starting and
ending vertices are the same (so you trace along every edge exactly once and end
up where you started), then the walk is called an Euler circuit (or Euler tour)."
12209,"Of
course if a graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a trail or circuit.
"
12210,"For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.
"

Euler trails."

12213,"This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that

(let alone an Euler circuit)."
12214,"On small graphs that do have an Euler trail, it is usually
not difficult to find one."

list?"
12230,"Select all the choices that could be true.
"
12231,"2.4.2
Conditions for Euler Trails
One way to guarantee that a graph does not have an Euler circuit is to include a
spike, a vertex of degree 1.
"
12232,"
The vertex has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that
you will get stuck at the vertex."
12233,It is a dead end.
12234,"That is, unless you start there."
12235,"But
then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit."
12236,"There
is however an Euler trail."
12237,"It starts at the vertex , then loops around the triangle.
"
12238,"You will end at the vertex of degree 3.
"
12239,"You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree.
"
12240,"If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every
edge exactly once)."
12241,"After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left

144
2."
12242,"Graph Theory
with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex."
12243,"Half of these could be
used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving."
12244,"So you return, then leave.
"
12245,"Return, then leave."
12246,"The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by
leaving the vertex."
12247,"On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree at which
you do not start a trail, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex."
12248,"The trail
will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again."
12249,"Eventually all
but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none
to leave again.
"
12250,"What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler trail and two vertices with odd
degree, then the Euler trail must start at one of the odd-degree vertices and end at
the other."
12251,"In such a situation, every other vertex must have an even degree since we
need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them."
12252,"How could
we have an Euler circuit?"
12253,"The graph could not have any odd-degree vertex as an
Euler trail would have to start there or end there, but not both."
12254,"Thus for a graph to
have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.
"
12255,"The converse is also true: if all the vertices of a graph have even degree, then the
graph has an Euler circuit, and if there are exactly two vertices with odd degree,
the graph has an Euler trail."
12256,"To prove this is a little tricky, but the basic idea is that
you will never get stuck because there is an outbound edge for every inbound
edge at every vertex."
12257,"If you try to make an Euler trail and miss some edges, you will
always be able to splice in a circuit using the edges you previously missed.
"
12258,"Euler Trails and Circuits.
"
12259,"A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is
even.
"
12260,"A graph has an Euler trail if and only if there are at most two vertices
with odd degree.
"
12261,"Since the bridges of Knigsberg graph has all four vertices with odd degree,
there is no Euler trail through the graph."
12262,"Thus there is no way for the townspeople
to cross every bridge exactly once.
"
12263,"2.4.3
Hamilton Paths
Suppose you wanted to tour Knigsberg in such a way that you visit each land
mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once."
12264,This can be done.
12265,"In graph
theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path that visits every vertex exactly
once."
12266,Such a path is called a Hamilton path (or Hamiltonian path).
12267,"We could also
consider Hamilton cycles, which are Hamilton paths that start and stop at the same
vertex.

"
12268,"Euler Trails and Circuits
145
Example 2.4.1
Determine whether the graphs below have a Hamilton path.
"
12269,"The graph on the left has a Hamilton path (many different ones,
actually), as shown here:
The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path."
12270,"You would need
to visit each of the outside vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get
stuck."
12271,"Note that this graph does not have an Euler trail, although there are
graphs with Euler trails but no Hamilton paths.
"
12272,"It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often
have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met."
12273,"However,
nobody knows whether this is true."
12274,"There is no known simple test for whether a
graph has a Hamilton path."
12275,"For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of
the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check whether there is a Hamilton path.
"
12276,"In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for
computers to solve in general, as it is an example of a problem that is NP-complete.

12347,"We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will
work for any map.
"
12348,How is this related to graph theory?
12349,"Well, if we place a vertex in the center of
each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their
states share a border, we get a graph."
12350,"Coloring regions on the map corresponds
to coloring the vertices of the graph."
12351,"Since neighboring regions cannot be colored
the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are
adjacent.
"
12352,"In general, given any graph , a coloring of the vertices is called (not surprisingly)
a vertex coloring."
12353,"If the vertex coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are
colored differently, then the coloring is called proper."
12354,"Every graph has a proper
vertex coloring."
12355,"For example, you could color every vertex with a different color.
"
12356,But often you can do better.
12357,"The smallest number of colors needed to get a proper
vertex coloring is called the chromatic number of the graph, written ().
"
12358,"Our goal in this section is to see how graph coloring can be used to solve some
problems and to understand some basic properties of graph coloring.

How many different time slots are needed to teach these classes (and which
should be taught at the same time)?"
12373,"More importantly, how could we use
graph coloring to answer this question?
"
12374,"The best way to get a feel for the chromatic number is to actually try to color
some graphs.
"
12375,"Example 2.5.1
Find the chromatic number of the graphs below.
"
12376,The graph on the left is 6.
12377,"The only way to properly color the
graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to
every other vertex)."
12378,"Thus the chromatic number is 6.
"
12379,"The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue,
and Green)."
12380,"For example:
R
B
G

2."
12381,"Graph Theory
There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three
vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle)."
12382,"Thus the chromatic number is 3.
"
12383,"The graph on the right is just 2,3."
12384,"As with all bipartite graphs, this graph
has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices
on the bottom row blue.
"
12385,It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get.
12386,"It
should not come as a surprise that has chromatic number ."
12387,"So how could
there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question?"
12388,"If the chromatic
number of a graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no
upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map."
12389,"But there is.
"
12390,"The key observation is that while it is true that for any number there is a graph
with chromatic number , only some graphs arrive as representations of maps."
12391,"If
you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders
between the countries."
12392,"So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way that
the edges do not cross."
12393,"In other words, the graphs representing maps are all planar!
"
12394,"So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph?
"
12395,"The answer is the best-known theorem of graph theory:
Theorem 2.5.2 The Four Color Theorem.
"
12396,"If is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of is less than or equal to 4."
12397,"Thus
any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.
"
12398,We will not prove this theorem.
12399,"Even though the theorem is easy to state
and understand, the proof is not."
12400,"In fact, there is currently no easy known proof
of the theorem."
12401,"The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check
an unavoidable set of 633 reducible configurations."
12402,"The idea is that every graph must
contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a
computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fe"
12403,Cartography is certainly not the only application of graph coloring.
12404,"There are
plenty of situations in which you might wish to partition the objects in question so
that related objects are not in the same set."
12405,"For example, you might wish to store
chemicals safely."
12406,"To avoid explosions, certain pairs of chemicals should not be stored
in the same room."
12407,"By coloring a graph (with vertices representing chemicals and
edges representing potential negative interactions), you can determine the smallest
number of rooms needed to store the chemicals.
"
12408,"Here is a further example:
Example 2.5.3

are a limited number of frequencies to choose from, so nationwide, many

12411,"This works because the stations are far
enough apart that their signals will not interfere; no one radio could pick
them up at the same time.
"
12412,"Suppose 10 new radio stations are to be set up in a currently unpopulated
(by radio stations) region."
12413,"The radio stations that are close enough to each
other to cause interference are recorded in the table below."

12424,"While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of a graph easily,
we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number."

12430,A clique in a graph is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent.
12431,"In
other words, a clique of size is just a copy of the complete graph ."
12432,"We define the
clique number of a graph to be the largest for which the graph contains a clique
of size . Any clique of size cannot be colored with fewer than colors, so we
have a nice lower bound:
The"
12433,These graphs have a special name; they are called perfect.
12434,"If you know that a graph
is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply a matter of searching for the
largest clique.8 However, not all graphs are perfect.
"
12435,"For an upper bound, we can improve on the number of vertices by looking
at the degrees of vertices."
12436,"Let () be the largest degree of any vertex in the
graph . One reasonable guess for an upper bound on the chromatic number is
() ()"
12437,Why is this reasonable?
12438,"Starting with any vertex, it together with
all of its neighbors can always be colored in ()"
12439,"+ 1 colors, since at most we are
talking about ()"
12440,+ 1 vertices in this set.
12441,Now fan out!
12442,"At any point, if you consider
an already colored vertex, some of its neighbors might be colored, some might not.
"
12443,"But no matter what, that vertex and its neighbors could all be colored distinctly,
since there are at most () neighbors, plus the one vertex being considered.
"
12444,"In fact, there are examples of graphs for which () = ()"
12445,"For any , the
complete graph has chromatic number , but () = 1 (since every vertex
is adjacent to every other vertex)."
12446,"Additionally, any odd cycle will have chromatic
number 3, but the degree of every vertex in a cycle is 2."

the only two types of examples where we get equality, a result known as Brooks
Theorem.

Coloring Edges
The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could
also ask about coloring edges."
12455,"Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that
adjacent edges must be colored differently."
12456,"Here, we are thinking of two edges as
being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex."
12457,"The least number of colors
required to properly color the edges of a graph is called the chromatic index of ,
written ().
"
12458,"Example 2.5.6
Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess."
12459,"Everyone will play
everyone else once."
12460,"They have plenty of chess sets, but nobody wants to play
more than one game at a time."
12461,"Games will last an hour (thanks to their handy
chess clocks)."
12462,"How many hours will the tournament last?
"
12463,"Represent each player with a vertex and put an edge between two
players if they play each other."
12464,"In this case, we get the graph 6:
We must color the edges; each color represents a different hour."
12465,"Since
different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored differently, no
player will be playing two different games (edges) at the same time."
12466,"Thus we
need to know the chromatic index of 6.
"
12467,"Notice that for sure (6) 5, since there is a vertex of degree 5."
12468,"It turns
out, 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring)."
12469,"Therefore the friends will
play for 5 hours.
"
12470,"Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5
chessletes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of 5 is also 5.
"
12471,"In general, what can we say about the chromatic index?"
12472,"Certainly () ().
"
12473,But how much higher could it be?

edges, quite different from what we have discussed so far."

Relations Generally
A graph is a way to represent some"

seen how to use graphs to represent which people are friends, or which classes have
time conflicts, or which radio stations are too close to have the same frequency."
12621,"Not

12622,"Graph Theory
all ways in which things can be related can be represented by a graph, however."
12623,"In
this section, we will consider the more general concept of a relation and see how
those might be related to graphs.
"
12624,"Consider the example of the relation between students and classes that holds
when a student is in that class (in a particular semester)."
12625,"This is a relation between
two different sets (the students and the classes)."
12626,"If we used a graph to illustrate this
relation, the graph would be bipartite, since two students are never related to each
other, and two classes are never related to each other.
"
12627,"A graph is really a set of vertices and a set of edges: = (, ); each element of
the set is a two-element subset of."
12628,"If we want to draw attention to the bipartiteness
of the graph, we can split up into its two sets and write = ((, ), )."
12629,"In this
notation, for the graph to be bipartite, we want each edge to be a pair (, ) where 
is an element of and is an element of . In other words, each edge is an element
of the Cartesian product of "
12630,"(Another way to say this is that  is the set of all ordered pairs of elements
from and .)
Note 2.6.1"
12631,"There is one subtlety here we should point out: the bipartite
graph we have described really has directed edges from to since we are
considering ordered pairs."
12632,"Our definition of a graph has edges as two-element
subsets of vertices, and subsets are not ordered."
12633,"As long as and are disjoint
sets, there is no confusion here, but we see relations in which and share
some elements, but we still care about the order."
12634,"More on that soon.
"
12635,This example exactly illustrates what a general binary relation is.
12636,"Here is the
careful definition.
"
12637,"Definition 2.6.2
A binary relation is a set of ordered pairs."
12638,"We say the binary relation is a
relation on sets"

pairs:

Consider the relation for is a multiple of on the set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
"
12647,Write this as a set of ordered pairs.
12648,"Does this relation create a graph?
Solution.
"
12649,"First, lets think about which elements should be related and
which should not."
12650,"We know that 6 is a multiple of 2, so the relation is true of
the pair (6, 2), but 6 is not a multiple of 4, so the pair (6, 4) does not satisfy the
relation."
12651,"More precisely, we say that (6, 2) but (6, 4) .
Lets list all the elements of :
= {(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4),
(5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2)(6, 3), (6, 6)}.
"
12652,"This relation is not a graph for two reasons: first, elements are related to
themselves, and second, the order of elements in the relation is not symmetric
(6 is related to 2, but 2 is not related to "
12653,"We can, however, still draw something like a graph to illustrate this
relation: Since the direction of the relation matters, we will have directed edges.
"
12654,This alone would create a directed graph.
12655,"Since vertices can have edges going
to themselves, we would call the structure a multigraph, so the relation can
be thought of as a directed multigraph.

12657,"That is, says how things in are related to things in ;
those things in are related to things in , just in an inverse (backward) way."
12658,"We
will call this new relation the inverse of .
Definition 2.6.5
Given a binary relation , define 1 to be the inverse of as the set
1 = {(, ) : (, ) }.
"
12659,"The relation from Example 2.6.3 said that a given student was in a particular
class."
12660,"The inverse relation 1 says that a given class has a particular student in
it."
12661,"For example, (Calculus, Al) is an element of 1."
12662,"Graphically, there wont be
any difference in the picture, although we could put the set of classes on top and
students on bottom.
"
12663,"The relation from Example 2.6.4 gave us that, for example, 6 is a multiple of 2,
since (6, 2) ."
12664,"For the inverse, we have (2, 6) 1, which means that 2 is a factor
of 6."
12665,"For this example, we have represented a relation as a directed multigraph."
12666,"The
graph of the inverse will look exactly the same, but all the arrows will point in the
opposite direction.
"
12667,Another way to create a new relation is to combine two relations.
12668,"Suppose in
addition to the is taking relation from Example 2.6.3, we define a relation is
taught by that matches up each course with its instructor."
12669,"Perhaps Professor X
teaches Calculus."
12670,"In that case, since Al is taking Calculus, and Calculus is taught by
Professor X, we can conclude that Al is taking a class with Professor X.

169
reason we do this (which might seem backward) is that it agrees with the usual
notation for composition of functions."
12673,"In fact, functions are nothing but a specific
type of relation!
"
12674,"Example 2.6.7
Write out the relation , composing the relations of Example 2.6.3 and =
{(Calculus, Prof X), (Discrete, Prof L), (Statistics, Prof X), (Statistics, Prof S)}."
12675,"Note
that here we are saying the statistic course is co-taught by professors X and S.
Solution.
"
12676,"The relation we are looking for is a relation between students and
professors."
12677,"We can start with each element of and extend it by following
the course to the professor(s) via . So for example, start with Cat, and
notice that (Cat, Calculus) ."
12678,"Now look at what Calculus is related to via
: (Calculus, Prof X) ."
12679,"Thus we can push these together to conclude that
(Cat, Prof X) .
"
12680,"An alternative approach would be to simply consider which pairs of
students and professors are linked by a common class."
12681,"Should the pair
(Al, Prof L) be an element of the composition?"
12682,"No, because there is no class
that is both taken by Al and taught by Professor L. On the other hand, we can
conclude the (Al, Prof X) since there is a common course."
12683,"In fact, the
common course could be Calculus or Statistics (it doesnt matter how many
common middle steps there are, as long as there is at least one).
"
12684,"Here is the complete relation:
= {(Al, Prof X), (Al, Prof S), (Bob, Prof X), (Bob, Prof L),

12687,"But functions are relations in which every input has exactly
one output, so perhaps it is not surprising that composing with an inverse just
gives you the identity function."
12688,"When inputs can have multiple outputs, and outputs
can have multiple inputs, then we get something more.
"
12689,"Example 2.6.8
Describe the relation 1(using our familiar relation from Example 2.6.3).
"
12690,"What does this tell us about students and classes?

"

and Calculus is taken by Al, so Al is related to Al."

by Bob, so now Al is also related to Bob."
12693,Is Bob related to Al as well?

12695,"Graph Theory
since Bob is taking Calculus and Calculus is taken by Al.
"
12696,"The composition is telling us which pairs of students have at least one
class in common."
12697,"Thats almost all pairs of students, except that Dirk is not
related to Bob or Eva, since they dont take Statistics, and that is the only class
he takes.

Properties of Relations
From this point on, we will just consider relations on a single set (so from a set to
itself)."
12701,"To help understand these relations, lets consider some basic properties a
relation might or might not have.

12702,"Definition 2.6.9 Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive.

Lets examine each of these properties carefully.
"
12706,"It will be helpful to consider a few standard examples of relations on sets as we
go."
12707,"Most relations we consider here will be written using infix notation, just meaning
that we put the relation symbol between the two things it is relating."
12708,"For example,
the less than relation is almost always written as 2 < 6 rather than writing (2, 6) <.

2.6."
12709,"Relations and Graphs
171
Example 2.6.10 Reflexive and non-reflexive relations.
"
12710,A relation is reflexive when every element is related to itself.
12711,"The following
are reflexive relations:
"
12712,The less-than-or-equal-to relation on any set of numbers.
12713,"Is it the case
that 3 3?"
12714,"More importantly, is every number no greater than itself?
"
12715,"Since the answer is yes, this relation is reflexive.
"
12716," The within 3 relation, that holds of two numbers and provided
|| 3."
12717,"To prove that this is reflexive, we simply note that || =
0 3.
"
12718, The is a multiple of relation from Example 2.6.4.
12719,"Note that the directed
multigraph for this relation had loops at every vertex.
"
12720,"However, these relations are not reflexive:
"
12721,"The sums to zero relation, that holds on numbers and if + = 0.
Note that while 0 + 0 = 0, so (0, 0) is an element of the relation, every
other number is not related to itself.
"
12722,Any relation that is described by a graph.
12723,"Remember, graphs cannot
have edges looping back to a single vertex, so the edge relation on a
graph is not reflexive."
12724,"(A multigraph could be reflexive or not).
"
12725,"If no element is related to itself (such as in the edge relation for a graph), then
we call the relation irreflexive."
12726,"Of course, some relations are neither reflexive nor
irreflexive.
"
12727,Checking that a relation is reflexive is relatively easy.
12728,"The other two properties
are phrased as implications, which makes them a little more complex.
"
12729,"Example 2.6.11 Symmetric and non-symmetric relations.
"
12730,"Essentially, symmetric relations are the ones that work both ways."
12731,"More
precisely, if is related to , then is also related to .
"
12732,"The following relations are symmetric.
"
12733,"The within 3 relation: if || 3 then || 3.
 The sums to zero relation: if + = 0, then certainly + = 0.
"
12734,"For any graph, the edge relation is symmetric."

graphs this is usually not true.

Relations that are not symmetric could in fact be antisymmetric, meaning the
only elements for which both (, ) and (, ) are in the relation is"
12743,"when = . Note
that there are relations that are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric.
"
12744,"Using the language of inverse relations, a relation is symmetric if and only if the
relation is equal to its inverse.

"
12746,"If is related to , and is related to , does that mean is related to ?"

12756,"All we need to do is find three
numbers that fail to meet the condition."
12757,"How about 1, 3, and 5?"
12758,"Here 1
is within 3 of 3, and 3 is within 3 of 5, but |1 5|"

Equivalence Relations
Now we will do something very typical for mathematics: We will look at our most
common types of relations,"

relations does the equality relation possess?"

so equality is reflexive."
12771,"If = , then = , so equality is symmetric."
12772,"If = and

"
12773,"What other relations are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive?"
12774,"Exactly those relations
that behave like equality."
12775,"We call such relations equivalence relations.
"
12776,"Definition 2.6.13 Equivalence Relation.
"
12777,"A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence
relation.
"
12778,"Remark 2.6.14
Another example of a type of relation that is modeled
after a classic relation is a partial order."
12779,"This is a relation that is reflexive,
antisymmetric, and transitive, just like less-than-or-equal-to."
12780,"Perhaps you
noticed already that the subset relation, written , feels a lot like . This is
because is also a partial order."
12781,"So is the is a multiple of relation we saw
above.
"
12782,"There are lots of interesting things we can say about partial orders and
the sets they partially order, called partially ordered sets or PoSets."
12783,"None of the examples we have considered so far in this section have been
equivalence relations, but they are ubiquitous in mathematics."
12784,"They are so common
that it is easy to overlook them as anything worth saying something about at all.
"
12785,"Lets see some examples.

12786,"Example 2.6.15

even, is an equivalence relation."
12787,"That is, 2 if and only if = 2for

and . What about ?"
12794,"Well,
= () + () = 2+ 2= 2(+ ).
"
12795,"Since + is an integer, we see that 2 as required.

2."
12796,"Graph Theory
Example 2.6.16
Lets call two graphs degree-sequence-equivalent if they have the same
degree sequence."
12797,"Is this an equivalence relation?
Solution.
"
12798,Yes it is.
12799,"Clearly every graph has the same degree sequence as
itself, so the relation is reflexive."
12800,"If 1 has the same degree sequence as 2,
then 2 has the same degree sequence as 1, so the relation is transitive.
"
12801,"Finally, if 1 has the same degree sequence as 2, which has the same degree
sequence as 3, then they all have the same degree sequence, so 1 has the
same degree sequence as 3 (i.e., the relation is tra"
12802,This example is almost too obvious.
12803,"Thats because we said that two things are
related if a well-defined property of those things was equal, and equality satisfies the
properties of an equivalence relation."

this and see that it is exactly what gives us an equivalence relation.

Equivalence Classes and Partitions
Given any relation , we can look at the set of elements that are related to a particular
element."

classes related to Al)."

multiple of."

each element.

12828,"Yes, because the difference of any two odd numbers is
even."
12829,"We can also say that the difference between any two even numbers is
even, so the equivalence class of 2 will contain all the even numbers."
12830,"So far
we have:

12831,[1] ={. . .

12835,"Actually, I think we are done."
12836,"While [3], [4], [5], and so on are all completely
valid equivalence classes, the elements that are related to 3 will be exactly the
elements related to 1, since 1 2 3."
12837,This is because the relation is transitive!
12838,"If

"
12839,So we have exactly two equivalence classes.

of these two equivalence classes, and the equivalence class of any integer is
exactly the class it belongs to.
Examine the two examples above carefully."

Definition 2.6.20
Given a non-empty set , a partition of is a set of non-empty subsets of
such that every element of is in exactly one element of .
That definition has a lot of symbols an"
12846,"Its really not complicated
though: A partition is a way to break up a set into disjoint subsets that cover the
whole set."
12847,"That the subsets are disjoint means no element is in more than one subset.
"
12848,"That the subsets cover the set means every element is in at least one subset.
"
12849,"Example 2.6.21
Give a few different partitions of the set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Solution.
"
12850,There are so many choices here!
12851,"One choice is:
1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}}.

2 = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}}.
Another:
3 = {{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4}},
which happens to be a partition into even and odd numbers."
12854,"We also have
the trivial partition:
4 = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}.
"
12855,"Note: that is a single set inside the set 4.
"
12856,"It is sometimes a little confusing to think of the elements of a partition as subsets
since the partition is a set, and a set of sets can be difficult to talk about."
12857,"We
sometimes call the partition a collection and each of the elements of the partition
parts or blocks.
"
12858,"Now the big idea: For any equivalence relation, the equivalence classes form
a partition, and for any partition, we can define a relation are in the same subset
which will be an equivalence relation."
12859,"We have already seen that the equivalence
classes of 2 form a partition."
12860,"Lets go the other direction.
"
12861,"Example 2.6.22
Define an equivalence relation on the set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} from the partition

Matching in Bipartite Graphs
Investigate!
"
12938,"Given a bipartite graph, a matching is a subset of the edges for which every
vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges."
12939,"Our goal in this activity is to
discover some criteria for when a bipartite graph has a matching.
"
12940,Does the graph below contain a matching?
12941,"If so, find one.
"
12942,Not all bipartite graphs have matchings.
12943,"Draw as many fundamentally
different examples of bipartite graphs that do NOT have matchings."
12944,"Your
goal is to find all the possible obstructions to a graph having a perfect
matching.
"
12945,"Write down the necessary conditions for a graph to have a
matching (that is, fill in the blank:"
12946,"If a graph has a matching, then
).
"
12947,"Then ask yourself whether these conditions are sufficient (is it true that if
, then the graph has a matching?).
"
12948,"We conclude with one more example of a graph theory problem to illustrate the
variety and vastness of the subject.
"
12949,Suppose you have a bipartite graph .
12950,"This will consist of two sets of vertices 
and with some edges connecting some vertices of to some vertices in (but of
course, no edges between two vertices both in or both in )."
12951,"A matching of is a
subset of the edges for which each vertex of belongs to exactly one edge of the
subset, and no vertex in belongs to more than one edge in the subset."
12952,"In practice,
we will assume that || = || (the two sets have the same number of vertices), so this
says that every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching.9
Some context might m"
12953,"Think of the vertices in as
representing students in a class, and the vertices in as representing presentation
topics."
12954,"We put an edge from a vertex to a vertex if student would
like to present on topic ."
12955,"Of course, some students would want to present on more
than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1."
12956,"As the teacher,
you want to assign each student their own unique topic."
12957,"Thus you want to find a
matching of : you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched
up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.10
9What we are calling a"
12958,"This is
because it is interesting to look at non-perfect matchings as well."

12961,The question is: when does a bipartite graph contain a matching of ?
12962,"To begin
to answer this question, consider what could prevent the graph from containing a
matching."
12963,"This will not necessarily tell us a condition when the graph does have a
matching, but at least it is a start.
"
12964,"One way could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in not adjacent to
any vertex in (so having degree 0)."
12965,"What if two students both like the
same topic, and no others?"
12966,"Then after assigning that one topic to the first student,
there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second
student has degree 0."
12967,"Or what if three students like only two topics between them?
Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this to the previous case of
two students liking only one topic."
12968,"We can continue this way with more and more
students.
"
12969,"It should be clear at this point that if there is a group of students who as a
group like 1 or fewer topics, then no matching is possible."
12970,"This is true for any
value of , and any group of students.
"
12971,"To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set of vertices."
12972,"Define
() to be the set of all the neighbors of vertices in . That is, () contains
all the vertices (in ) that are adjacent to at least one of the vertices in . (In the

Is the converse true?"
12974,"Suppose satisfies the matching condition |()| || for
all (every set of vertices has at least as many neighbors as vertices in the set).
"
12975,Does that mean that there is a matching?
12976,"The obvious necessary
condition is also sufficient.11 This is a theorem first proved by Philip Hall in 1935.12

There are quite a few different proofs of this theorem  a quick internet search

representing one of the 13 card values, and 13 vertices in the set , each
representing one of the 13 piles."
12992,"Draw an edge between a vertex to
a vertex if a card with value is in the pile . Notice that we are just
looking for a matching of ; each value needs to be found in the piles exactly
once.
"
12993,We will have a matching if the matching condition holds.
12994,"Given any set
of card values (a set ), we must show that |()| ||."
12995,"That is, the
number of piles that contain those values is at least the number of different
values."
12996,But what if it wasnt?
12997,Say || = .
12998,"If |()| < , then we would have
fewer than 4different cards in those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards).
"
12999,"But there are 4cards with the different values, so at least one of these cards
must be in another pile, a contradiction."

Chapter Summary
Hopefully this chapter has given you some sense of the wide variety of graph theory
topics as well as why these studies are interesting."
13042,"There are many more interesting
areas to consider, and the list is increasing all the time; graph theory is an active
area of mathematical research.
"
13043,"One reason graph theory is such a rich area of study is that it deals with such a
fundamental concept: Any pair of objects can either be related or not related."
13044,"What
the objects are and what related means varies depending on context, and this
leads to many applications of graph theory to science and other areas of math."
13045,"The
objects can be countries, and two countries can be related if they share a border."
13046,"The
objects could be land masses that are related if there is a bridge between them."
13047,"The
objects could be websites that are related if there is a link from one to the other."
13048,"Or
we can be completely abstract: The objects are vertices that are related if there is an
edge between them.
"
13049,"What question we ask about the graph depends on the application, but often
leads to deeper, general and abstract questions worth studying in their own right.
"
13050,"Here is a short summary of the types of questions we have considered:
 Can the graph be drawn in the plane without edges crossing?"
13051,"If so, how many
regions does this drawing divide the plane into?
 Is it possible to color the vertices of the graph so that related vertices have
different colors using a small number of colors?"
13052,"How many colors are needed?
"
13053," Is it possible to trace over every edge of a graph exactly once without lifting
your pencil?"
13054,"What other sorts of paths might a graph possess?
"
13055,Can you find subgraphs with certain properties?
13056,"For example, when does a
(bipartite) graph contain a subgraph in which all vertices are only related to
one other vertex?
"
13057,"Not surprisingly, these questions are often related to each other."
13058,"For example,
the chromatic number of a graph cannot be greater than 4 when the graph is planar.
"
13059,"Whether the graph has an Euler trail depends on how many vertices each vertex is
adjacent to (and whether those numbers are always even or not)."

of matchings in bipartite graphs can be proved using paths.

In 1653, Blaise Pascal, concerned with questions that would lay the foundation
of probability theory, collected several facts about a triangular array of numbers in
his Treatise on Arithmetic"
13166,"This arrangement of numbers appeared as early
as the 10th century in China, India, and Persia."
13167,"The Chinese and Persian treatment
of the triangle was in service of what we would now consider algebra: finding
th roots, essentially solving polynomial equations."
13168,"The numbers in the triangle
appear as solutions to counting problems in Indian texts: from six tastes, how many
combinations of one, or two, or three,... can you make?"
13169,"European mathematicians
in the 14th century presented the triangle as a table of figurate numbers (numbers
that can be arranged in a geometric shape), which were themselves the centerpiece
of the work"

Lattice Paths
The integer la"
13194,"If you like to draw graphs on graph paper, the lattice
is the set of all the intersections of the grid lines.
"
13195,"A lattice path is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the
lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically."
13196,"For example, here are three possible
lattice paths from the point (0, 0) to (3, 2):

13197,"Counting
(0,0)
(3,2)
(0,0)

(3,2)
Notice that to ensure the path is the shortest possible, each move must be either
to the right or up."
13198,"Additionally, in this case, no matter what path we take, we must
make three steps right and two steps up."
13199,"No matter in what order we make these
steps, there will always be five steps."
13200,"Thus each path has length five.
"
13201,"The counting question we will ask is this: how many lattice paths are there
between (0, 0) and (3, 2)?"
13202,"In this case, drawing all the paths wouldnt take too long.
"
13203,"Or we could list each path as a string of directions such as , , or
, which correspond to the three paths drawn above, where an means travel
one unit in the direction, and similarly for ."
13204,"We would get the following ten
paths:









.
When the distance between starting and stopping points is larger, we will want to
find a more efficient way to count the paths.
"
13205,"Lets take what we learned from the rook paths (which are, gasp, actually lattice
paths)."
13206,"Consider the lattice shown below:
(0,0)
(3,2)


Any lattice path from (0,0) to (3,2) must pass through exactly one of and .
The point is 4 steps away from (0,0) and two of them are in the direction."
13207,"The
last step is also in the direction, so the paths from (0,0) to (3,2) that pass through 
are exactly the six strings we listed above that end in an . For the paths that pass
through point , the las"
13208,"So the total number of paths to (3,2) is just 6 + 4.

and end at (, ), we can find the number of paths to the point directly to the left of
the endpoint, (1, ) and add "

Bit Strings
Bit is short for binary digit, so a bit string is a string of binary digits."

digits are simply the numbers 0 and 1."

1001

1010101010.
"
13221,"The number of bits (0s or 1s) in the string is the length of the string; the strings
above have lengths 4, 1, 4, and 10 respectively."
13222,"We also can ask how many of the bits
are 1s."
13223,"The number of 1s in a bit string is the weight of the string; the weights of
the above strings are 2, 0, 4, and 5 respectively.

"
13224,"Counting
Definition 3.1.3 Bit Strings.
"
13225,"An -bit string is a bit string of length . That is, it is a string containing
symbols, each of which is a bit, either 0 or 1.
"
13226,"The weight of a bit string is the number of 1s in it.
"
13227," B
is the set of all -bit strings of weight .
"
13228,"For example, the elements of the set B3
2 are the bit strings 011, 101, and 110."
13229,"Those
are the only strings containing three bits, exactly two of which are 1s.
"
13230,The counting questions: How many 5-bit strings have weight 3?
13231,"In other words,
we are asking for the cardinality |B5
3|.
"
13232,"Lets just list them and see how many there are.

"
13233,Ten of them.
13234,"Actually, I have a confession: I didnt type all of these from
scratch."
13235,"Instead I just modified the list of 10 lattice paths from (0,0) to (3,2) that we
found earlier."
13236,Each became a 1 and each became a 0.
13237,"After all, any lattice path
with length that requires steps in the direction can be represented by a string
of symbols of two types, with of those symbols being of one type."
13238,"Whether
we call the two symbols and or"
13239,"we call them 1 and 0 will not change how many
strings we get.
"
13240,"It is not surprising then that the same relationship between Pascals triangle and
lattice paths holds for bit strings."
13241,Look at the 10 strings above.
13242,"The first row contains
all the bit strings of B5
3 that end in a 0."
13243,"Before that ending 0, we have a string in B4
3,
since it must have length 4 and weight 3 (the ending 0 increases the length, but not
the weight)."
13244,"The second row contains all the bit strings of B5
3 that end in a 1."
13245,"Before
that ending 1, we have a string in B4
2, since it must have length 4 and weight 2 (the
ending 1 increases the length and the weight)."
13246,"So the number of 5-bit strings of
weight 3 is the sum of the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3 and the number of
4-bit strings of weight 2."
13247,"In symbols:
|B5
3| = |B4
3| + |B4
2|.
"
13248,"Now we have two good reasons to believe that Pascals triangle tells us the
number of bit strings of a given weight: There is a one-to-one correspondence
between lattice paths and bit strings, and the "

set has five elements, so we need five bits to represent a subset of ."
13261,"If the bit in
position is a 0, that means we do not include in our subset, while a 1 in that

13293,"Earlier we said that one of the original uses for Pascals triangle was to solve problems
in algebra."

with algebra?
Suppose you expand the binomial expression (+ 1)6 (i.e., multiply the binomial
+ 1 by itself six times)."

system such as SageMath can do this easily.

13402,"3.2.2
What are Outcomes?
"
13403,"Before we start counting, a quick note about how we ask counting problems."
13404,"Often
counting problems are asked terms of how many ways something can happen."
13405,"That
is, there is some event that can result in different outcomes, and it is the different
outcomes that are counted."
13406,"Alternatively, we can take a less active view by asking
for the number of elements in a set, such as the set of bit strings of a particular length
and weight."
13407,"However, this too could be rephrased as a question about an event: if
you randomly select one of the bit strings (from the set of bit strings), how many
things can happen?
"
13408,"So counting the elements in a set or counting the number of outcomes of an
event is not really different."
13409,"Lets think of every counting problem as asking for the
number of elements in a set of outcomes.
"
13410,"At the most basic level, counting is not hard at all: Just write all the outcomes in
a numbered list and see how many numbers you use."
13411,"Let me tell you about my bow
tie collection."
13412,"I have,
1."
13413,"A purple bow tie.
"
13414,"A green bow tie.
"
13415,"A striped bow tie.
"
13416,"A paisley bow tie.
"
13417,How many bow ties do I have (how many ways can I select a bow tie)?
13418,"Well, the
largest number in my numbered list is 4, so I have four bow ties.1"
13419,"Of course, as
we saw in the previous section, we can use shortcuts to avoid listing out all of the
outcomes, such as using Pascals triangle to find the number of items in our list.
"
13420,"Where counting begins to get interesting is when we want to make a new list
that combines two or more lists we have already counted."
13421,"For example, suppose
that in addition to my list of four bow ties, I had a list of seven pairs of novelty socks.
"
13422,"I could ask how many choices I have if I wanted to wear either a cool bow tie or a
pair of novelty socks."
13423,"Okay, combine my two lists to make a new list with 11 items:
Perhaps first list the four bow ties and then keep counting (starting with 5 for the
first pair of socks) until you have listed the seven a"
13424,1Obviously this example is quite outdated; only four bow ties?
13425,"What sort of mathematician do you
take me for?

3.2."
13426,"Combining Outcomes
207
In this example, we have combined our two sets of outcomes (picking a bow tie
and picking a pair of socks) to get a new set of outcomes (picking a bow tie or pair
of socks)."
13427,"That resulting set of outcomes contained 11 elements.
"
13428,"Now consider the question: How many choices do I have if I want to wear both
a bow tie and a pair of novelty socks?"
13429,"Again, I need to combine my two sets of
outcomes to get a new set of outcomes."
13430,"But this new set of outcomes will contain
28 elements."
13431,"How did I know that I should multiply the number of elements in
each of my original sets, instead of adding them?"
13432,"We are once again combining
outcomes: The resulting set of outcomes that contains 28 elements that are all
outcomes consisting of a bow tie and a pair of socks."
13433,"Now read the previous
paragraph!"
13434,"They sound very close to each other!
"
13435,The difference between the two scenarios is subtle.
13436,"There are two ways we can
think of combining outcomes:
"
13437,"We can combine the sets of outcomes.
"
13438,"We can combine the outcomes in the sets.
"
13439,"Being able to distinguish between these operations is a key skill in combinatorics.
"
13440,"Example 3.2.1
Suppose your refrigerator door has some magnetic letters and numerals on
it: There are five letters (A, B, C, D, and E) and three numerals (1, 2, and 3).
"
13441,"Your brother says that if you combine these sets of magnets, you will get a
collection of 8 magnets."

in 15 ways.

set of outcomes for the letters is {, , , , } and the set of outcomes for
the numerals is {1, 2, 3}."
13446,"The set of outcomes for the combined set of magnets
is {, , , , , 1, 2, 3}, which contains 8 elements.
"
13447,Your sister is thinking of combining the outcomes themselves.
13448,"The set
of outcomes is {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3},
which contains 15 elements.
"
13449,"3.2.3
The Sum and Product Principles
Lets carefully write down the rules we can use to combine sets of outcomes and
outcomes in sets.
"
13450,"Principle 3.2.2 Sum Principle.
"
13451,"If an event results in outcomes, and event results in disjoint outcomes,
then the event or  results in + outcomes.

"
13452,"Counting
It is important that the events be disjoint: i.e., that there is no way for and to
both happen at the same time."
13453,"For example, a standard deck of 52 cards contains 26
red cards and 12 face cards."
13454,"However, the number of ways to select a card which is
either red or a face card is not 26 + 12 = 38."
13455,"This is because there are 6 cards which
are both red and face cards.
"
13456,"Example 3.2.3
How many two-letter words start with either A or B?"
13457,"(A word is just a
sequence of letters; it doesnt have to be English, or even pronounceable.)
"
13458,"First, how many two-letter words start with A?"
13459,"We just need to
select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26 ways."
13460,"So there are
26 words starting with A. There are also 26 words that start with B. To select a
word that starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or
the second 26, for a total "
13461,"We have two sets of outcomes: the words starting with A and the words
starting with B."
13462,"We create a new set of outcomes by combining the sets to get
the set of words that start with either A or B, and by the sum principle, this
new set contains 52 outcomes.
"
13463,"We often use the principle when the sets of outcomes need to be counted using
other counting techniques.
"
13464,"Example 3.2.4
How many 10-bit strings of weight 6 start with either 11 or 00?
Solution.
"
13465,"We learned how to count bit strings with a fixed length and weight
in Section 3.1."
13466,"The total number of 10-bit strings of weight 6 is  10
6

= 210
(where that value was found using Pascals triangle)."
13467,"However, we want to
count just those that start with 11 or 00 (and not those that start with 10 or 01).
"
13468,"Since there are no bit strings that start with both 11 and 00, we can apply
the sum principle."
13469,"We will compute the size of each set of outcomes and then
add the results.
"
13470,How many 10-bit strings of weight 6 start with 11?
13471,"If the string starts with
11, then of the remaining eight bits, there must be four 1s, so that the total
weight is 6."
13472,"This is just like asking for the number of 8-bit strings with weight
4, so there are  8
4

= 70 such strings."
13473,"Similarly, there are  8
6

= 28 strings that
start with 00 (all six 1s must be in the remaining 8 bits)."
13474,"By the sum principle,
the total number of strings we want to count is 70 + 28 = 98.

13475,"We can also use the sum principle indirectly in a way that might be called the
subtraction principle (but isnt).

Example 3.2.5
How many 10-bit strings of weight 6 have at least one 1 in their first three bits?
Solution.
"
13477,"There are lots of different ways a string can have at least one 1 in
its first three bits: It could start with 100, 010, 001, 101, 110, 011, or 111."
13478,"We
could count the number of strings that start with each of them and then apply
the sum principle a bunch of times."
13479,"But lets not.
"
13480,"Suppose the number of strings we want to count is . Let be the number
of 10-bit strings of weight 6 that do not have a 1 in any of their first three bits.
"
13481,What is + ?
13482,"This is the number of 10-bit strings of weight 6 in total, which
is  10
6

= 210."
13483,"It is also easy to find : Bit strings with length 10 and weight 6
that start with 000 must end in a bit string with length 7 and weight 6."
13484,"There
are  7
6

= 7 of these.
"
13485,"Thus, we have
+ 7 = 210,
so = 210 7 = 203.
"
13486,"While we didnt want to use the sum principle multiple times in the previous
example, we could have."
13487,The sum principle works with more than two events.
13488,"Say,
in addition to your four bow ties and seven pairs of socks, you could also pick
one of five belt buckles."
13489,How many choices do you have now?
13490,"You would have
4 + 7 + 5 = 16 options.
"
13491,"Example 3.2.6
How many two-letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?
Solution.
"
13492,"There are 26 two-letter words starting with A, another 26 starting
with E, and so on."
13493,"By the sum principle, the total number of words will then
be 26 + 26 + 26 + 26 + 26 = 130 Of course it would be easier to just multiply
5  26.
"
13494,"Note that in the previous example, when using the sum principle on a bunch of
outcome sets of the same size, it is quicker to multiply."
13495,"Lets take advantage of this
observation and state it as a new principle.
"
13496,"Principle 3.2.7 Product Principle.
"
13497,"If event can occur in ways, and each possibility for allows for exactly ways
for event , then the event and  can occur in  ways.
"
13498,"A nice way to picture the product principle is to think of the outcomes as levels
in a tree."
13499,"To illustrate this, consider the counting question of Example 3.2.1: How
many ways can you select a letter from {, , , , } followed by a numeral from
{1, 2, 3}?"

Each leaf of the tree corresponds to an outcome."
13502,"The tree shows that the three
outcomes of the second level are repeated five times, once for each outcome of the
first level.
"
13503,"Example 3.2.8
How many two-letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?"
13504,"This time use the
product principle to answer the question.
Solution.
"
13505,"How can we think of selecting a two-letter word as a sequence of
two events that both happen?"
13506,"Event is selecting the vowel that starts the
word."
13507,Event is selecting the second letter for the word.
13508,"By the product
principle, there are 5  26 = 130 ways for the event and  to occur.
"
13509,"Of course the solutions to Example 3.2.6 and Example 3.2.8 are the same, but the
outcomes we are combining and the ways we are combining them are different.
"
13510,"When applying the sum principle, we combined five disjoint sets of outcomes.
"
13511,"One such set of outcomes was,
{, , , , . ."
13512,", }
and another was,
{, , , , . . ."
13513,"That is, each set of outcomes was a set of 2-letter words, starting with a different
vowel."
13514,"The sum principle combined these five sets to create a new set that contained
exactly the same elements in the original sets, just all together in one set.
"
13515,"On the other hand, when we applied the product principle, we combined the
outcomes in two sets."
13516,"The first set was,
{, , , , }

3.2."
13517,"Combining Outcomes
211
and the second set was,
{, , , , . ."
13518,"The product principle combines the elements in those sets to make a set of new
outcomes (outcomes not present in any of the sets being combined).
"
13519,"As with the sum principle, we often use the product principle to define sets of
outcomes that first need to be counted carefully.
"
13520,"Example 3.2.9
How many lattice paths from (0, 0) to (10, 10) pass through the point (4, 7)?
Solution.
"
13521,"We can count lattice paths with Pascals triangle, but how do we
ensure that the path passes through a particular point?"
13522,"Well, any path that
passes through (4, 7) must first go from (0, 0) to (4, 7), and then complete its
journey with a path from (4, 7) to (10, 10).
"
13523,"The number of paths from (0, 0) to (4, 7) is  11
4

= 330.
"
13524,"The number of paths from (4, 7) to (10, 10) is  9
3

= 84."
13525,"(The paths have
length 9 and with 6 steps in the direction.)
"
13526,"Now combine these with the... wait, what principle?"
13527,"To get a path from
(0, 0) to (10, 10) that passes through (4, 7), we need to first select a path from
(0, 0) to (4, 7) and then add on a path from (4, 7) to (10, 10)."
13528,"So is this the sum
principle???
"
13529,"No! Remember that the sum principle combines the two sets of outcomes.
"
13530,"If we applied the sum principle, we would get a larger set containing the
330 + 84 paths that are contained in each individual set."
13531,"None of these are
paths we want to count."
13532,"We want to combine the different elements in our
sets of outcomes in every possible combination."
13533,"That is why the product
principle is correct here.
"
13534,"Thus, the total number of paths we want to count is 330  84 = 27720.
"
13535,"The product principle generalizes to more than two events as well.
"
13536,"Example 3.2.10
How many license plates can you make out of three letters followed by three
numerical digits?
Solution.
"
13537,"Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter, the third
letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit."
13538,"The first three events
can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can each happen in 10 ways."
13539,"So the
total number of license plates will be 26  26  26  10  10  10, using the product
principle.
"
13540,Does this make sense?
13541,"Think about how we would pick a license plate.
"
13542,How many choices would we have?
13543,"First, we need to pick the first letter.
"
13544,There are 26 choices.
13545,"Now for each of those, there are 26 choices for the

212
3."
13546,"Counting
second letter: 26 second letters with first letter A, 26 second letters with first
letter B, and so on."
13547,We add 26 to itself 26 times.
13548,"Or quicker: there are 26  26
choices for the first two letters.
"
13549,"Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices for the
third letter."
13550,"That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters AA, 26 choices for
the third letter after starting AB, and so on."
13551,"There are 26  26 of these 26 third
letter choices, for a total of (26  26)  26 choices for the first three letters."
13552,"And
for each of these 26  26  26 choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for
the remaining digits.
"
13553,"In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers."
13554,"We can
see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers (000 through 999)."
13555,"This
is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third."
13556,"The
product principle says we multiply: 10  10  10 = 1000.
"
13557,"All together, there were 263 choices for the three letters and 103 choices
for the numbers, so we have a total of 263  103 choices of license plates.
"
13558,The previous example had an answer that used exponents.
13559,"So is there an
exponential principle we should learn?"
13560,"We dont separate one out as there really
isnt anything different in the way we think of constructing our outcome sets."
13561,"But
we will often see the product principle applied to the same event repeated multiple
times."
13562,"Here are two examples.
"
13563,"Example 3.2.11
Suppose you roll a 12-sided die seven times, recording the number that
appears after each roll."
13564,"How many sequences of seven rolls are possible?
"
13565,"Each roll can result in 12 different outcomes, so by the product
principle, the total number of sequences is 127.
Example 3.2.12
How many different pizzas can you make if you can choose from 10 toppin"
13566,"If we want to apply the product principle, we must think of the
compound event of picking a pizza as the result of combining some number
of individual events in every possible combination."
13567,"What are those events?
"
13568,"There are multiple answers to this question, but the following is the most
useful.
"
13569,"First, decide whether you want to include anchovies on your pizza or not.
"
13570,This event could result in two outcomes (yes or no to the anchovies).
13571,"Second,
decide whether you want black olives."
13572,"Then Canadian bacon, then diced
tomatoes, etc."
13573,"Each event has two outcomes, and we must combine all ten of

3.2."
13574,"Combining Outcomes
213
these outcomes to create a single outcome corresponding to a single pizza.
"
13575,"Thus, by the product principle, there are 210 possible pizzas.
"
13576,"By the way, another approach to this problem is to code each pizza as a
bit-string, where a 1 means the topping is included and a 0 means it is not.
"
13577,Then the number of pizzas is the number of bit-strings of length 10.
13578,"Each bit
in the string has two possible values, so there are 210 10-bit strings.
"
13579,Careful: and doesnt mean times.
13580,"For example, how many playing cards
are both red and a face card?"
13581,Not 26  12.
13582,"The answer is 6, and we needed to know
something about cards to answer that question.
"
13583,"Example 3.2.13 Counting functions.
"
13584,"How many functions : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {, , , } are there?
Solution.
"
13585,"Remember that a function sends each element of the domain to
exactly one element of the codomain."
13586,"To determine a function, we just need
to specify the image of each element in the domain."
13587,"Where can we send 1?
There are 4 choices."
13588,Where can we send 2?
13589,"Again, 4 choices."
13590,"What we have
here is 5 events (picking the image of an element in the domain) each of
which can happen in 4 ways (the choices for that image)."
13591,"Thus there are
4  4  4  4  4 = 45 functions.
"
13592,"This is more than just an example of how we can use the product principle in
a particular counting question."
13593,"What we have here is a general interpretation
of certain applications of the product principle using rigorously defined
mathematical objects: functions."
13594,"Whenever we have a counting question that
asks for the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that as
asking for the number of functions from {1, 2, . ."
13595,". , } (where is the number
of times the event is repeated) to {1, 2, . ."
13596,", } (where is the number of ways
that event can occur).
"
13597,"3.2.4
Combining Principles
Lets return to this sections Investigate!"
13598,"question: How many ways can you select
two cards from a standard deck of 52, so that the first one is a red card and the
second one is a face card?
"
13599,"This looks a little like the product principle since the outcomes consist of pairs of
cards."
13600,"There are 26 red cards that are outcomes for the first event, and 12 face cards
that are outcomes for the second event."
13601,"However, the answer is not 26  12."
13602,"The
problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the
case that for each of those, there are 12 ways to select the second card."
13603,"If the first card
was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second
card.
"
13604,"In Section 3.3 we will explore some ways to adjust for counting problems when
events are not disjoint, but we can solve our card problem now if we are careful.

"
13605,"Counting
Think about the entire set of two-card outcomes."
13606,"Can we split these outcomes into
two disjoint sets (as to apply the sum principle) such that each set can be formed
using the product principle?
"
13607,"Of all the outcomes, we first count those that start with a red, non-face card."
13608,"Of
the 26 red cards, there are 6 that are face cards, so there are 20 red, non-face cards.
"
13609,"For each of these, there are 12 face cards that can be selected as the second card.
"
13610,"By the product principle, the number of two-card outcomes starting with a red,
non-face card is 20  12 = 240.
"
13611,"Now, what outcomes have we not yet counted?"
13612,"It is exactly the two-card outcomes
that start with a red face card."
13613,"There are 6 cards we could start with, and for each
there are 11 choices for the second card."
13614,"So the number of two-card outcomes
starting with a red face card is 6  11 = 66.
"
13615,"Finally, apply the sum principle to these two disjoint sets of outcomes to see that
the total number of two-card outcomes is 240 + 66 = 306.
"
13616,"We conclude this section with two more examples of how you can use both the
sum and product principles in a single counting problem.
"
13617,"Example 3.2.14
How many lattice paths from (0, 0) to (9, 9) pass through either (2, 6) or (6, 2)?
Solution.
"
13618,"We are quite fortunate that no paths from (0, 0) to (9, 9) pass
through both (2, 6) and (6, 2)."
13619,"This means we can apply the sum principle to
the two sets of outcomes: the paths that pass through (2, 6) and the paths
that pass through (6, 2)."
13620,"We will apply the product principle to determine the
number of paths in each of these disjoint sets of outcomes.
"
13621,"The paths from (0, 0) to (9, 9) that pass through (2, 6) are each the con-
catenation of paths from (0, 0) to (2, 6) and paths from (2, 6) to (9, 9)."
13622,"There
are  8
2

= 28 paths for the first part and  10
7

= 120 paths for the second part,
so applying the product principle gives us 28  120 = 3360 paths that pass
through (2, 6).
"
13623,"The paths from (0, 0) to (9, 9) that pass through (6, 2) can similarly be
calculated as

8
6



10
3

= 28  120 = 3360
(and upon reflection, it is not surprising that the two numbers are the same,"
13624,"Thus, the total number of paths that pass through either (2, 6) or (6, 2) is
3360 + 3360 = 6720.

3.2."
13625,"Combining Outcomes
215
Example 3.2.15
How many two-digit numbers, using only the digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} have the
sum of their digits even?
Solution.
"
13626,First think about the set of outcomes.
13627,"Some two-digit numbers
that have the sum of their digits even are 11, 13, 15, 22, 24, 31, . ."
13628,"Okay, maybe
it isnt all that difficult to just list them all (and this would be a nice way to
check our work)."
13629,"Lets try to use the sum and product principles anyway.
"
13630,What do we notice about all these numbers?
13631,"It looks like both digits must
be even or both digits must be odd, to make the sum even."
13632,"We can consider
these two cases, counting each case with the product principle.
"
13633,"Counting odd-odd numbers: three choices for the first digit and three
choices for the second digit."
13634,"So there are 3  3 = 9 odd-odd numbers.
"
13635,"Counting even-even numbers: two choices for the first digit and two
choices for the second digit."
13636,"So there are 2  2 = 4 even-even numbers.
"
13637,"Combined, there are 9 + 4 = 13 two-digit numbers with an even sum of
digits.

13724,"Let be the set of outcomes for the first event and be the set of outcomes for
the second event."

13726,"This is
nothing more than the union of the set and , written .
The sum principle only applies when no outcome belongs to both events."

there are no elements in the intersection, so the intersection is the empty set, written

"
13734,Suppose we want to find || and know that || = 10 and || = 8.

13738,"Now we can
say exactly how many elements are in , and, of those, how many are in and how
many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in , so 4 are in but not in )."
13739,"We could fill
in a Venn diagram as follows:


6

This says there are 6 elements in , 4 elements in but not (which"
13740,"we
can write as |\ | = 4), and 2 elements in but not (written |\ | = 2)."
13741,"Now
these three sets are disjoint, so we can use the sum principle to find the number of
elements in ."
13742,"It is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.

the numbers in each of the eight disjoint regions)."

generalization of the case where the sets are disjoint.
Consider again the example where || = 10, || = 8 and ||"
13786,"We said
that ||"
13787,"= 12, found by adding 4 + 6 + 2.
"

13790,"So perhaps we
guess,
"
13791,"|| = || + || || .

13792,This makes sense!
13793,"When we add the number of elements in to the number of

13829,Lets use this example to understand the theorem better.
13830,"Consider the
number 21."

13832,"It is in , but not or , so it is
counting among the 16 multiples of 3 and not counted in any of the other sets,

13833,"Similarly for all other
numbers that are multiples of just one of 2, 3, or 5.
"
13834,"The number 18 is in sets and , and so also in . It is counted in
the 25 multiples of 2, the 16 multiples of 3, and the 8 multiples of 6."
13835,"So it is
added twice in our total and subtracted once, meaning it is counted exactly
one time."
13836,"The same will be true of all numbers that belong to exactly two of
the individual sets.
"
13837,What about 30?
13838,It belongs to all the sets.
13839,"It is therefore added to our total
three times, when we add the multiples of 2, 3, and 5."
13840,"But it is also subtracted
three times, once for each of the three pairs of sets."
13841,"So it is not counted at all
in our total... until we add it back in in the last step, after which it is counted
exactly once.
"
13842,"This process of adding in, then subtracting out, then adding back in, and so on
is called the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, or simply PIE."
13843,"This principle can be
applied to any number of sets, but the formula becomes more and more complicated
the more sets you have."

hopefully we all see what you would have to write down."
13849,"In practice, PIE for more
than three sets is only used when we can simplify the computation by recognizing
that, for example, all the intersections of two sets will have the same size."

examples of this are explored in Section 3.8.

13851,"3.3.4
Overlaps and the Product Principle
Everything we have considered so far in this section has been about how the sum
principle applies when the sets of outcomes are not disjoint."
13852,"Do we need to be
similarly worried about overlaps when applying the product principle?
Not really.
"
13853,"One use of the product principle is to compute probabilities, and in that context,
we do make a distinction between events being independent or dependent."
13854,"We will
explore this more in Section 3.7."
13855,"Essentially, to find the probability of two events
occuring, we can multiply their respective probabilities if and only if the two events
are independent: if the outcome of one event does not affect t"
13856,"While finding probability is closely related to counting outcomes, the product
principle itself does not require that sets of outcomes be disjoint or make a distinction
between dependent or independen"
13857,"What does matter is that the number of
outcomes for the second event does not change based on which outcome was the
result of the first event.
"
13858,"A distinction we do often make when applying the product principle is whether
the outcomes of events can be repeated."
13859,"Consider the following example.
"
13860,"Example 3.3.8
How many 3-letter words (sequences of three letters) are there when,
1. repeats are allowed?
2. repeats are not allowed?
"
13861,"Being careful with the product principle, we are combining three
events:"
13862,"is the event of selecting the first letter, is the event of selecting
the second letter, and is the event of selecting the third letter."
13863,"If we want
to count the number of words when letters in the word can be repeated,
then each event contains 26 outcomes."
13864,"So the number of 3-letter words is
263 = 17, 576 when repeats are allowed.
"
13865,"When repeats are not allowed, then the number of outcomes for event is
still 26, but the number of outcomes for is only 25, since no matter what the
outcome of event is, that letter cannot be selected"
13866,"Counting
the word."
13867,"Similarly, no matter what the outcomes of event and are, the
number of outcomes for event is always 24: any letter not selected in the
first two events."
13868,"Thus the number of 3-letter words containing no repeated
letters is 26  25  24 = 15, 600.
"
13869,"Its a little strange that the actual set of outcomes for event is different
for each possible outcome of event ."
13870,"This doesnt matter though, as long as
the size of the outcome set doesnt change.
"
13871,"We will explore problems such as the previous example in much more depth
next in Section 3.4."
13872,"Before that though, here is a final example of where the product
principle does NOT easily work.
"
13873,"Example 3.3.9
Explain why the product principle does NOT apply to the following counting
question: How many 3-letter words have their letters in alphabetical order?
"
13874,"The first thing we might try is to make event be selecting the
first letter, be selecting the second letter, and be selecting the third letter.
"
13875,There are 26 outcomes to event .
13876,"How many outcomes are there for event
?"
13877,"If we selected as the first letter, then we can select a letter in the set
{, , , } as our second letter, so it appears there are 4 outcomes for event
."
13878,"However, if we selected as our first letter, then any letter could be used
for the second letter, so event has 26 outcomes."
13879,"The problem is that the number of outcomes for the second (and third) letter
in the word changes depending on the outcome of the previous event."
13880,"The
events are not independent, but more than that, their size is not independent,
so the product principle does not apply.
"
13881,"We will see how to answer the counting problem above in the case that letters
can be repeated in Section 3.5."
13882,"If we restricted the question further and required that
the letters be distinct (and in alphabetical order), we already know how to answer
the question."
13883,"Since for any set of three letters, there is exactly one 3-letter word that
has those letters in alphabetical order, we can simply count the number of sets of
three letters."
13884,"This is  26

."
13885,Then we just look at Pascals triangle to find the value...

compute the value without the triangle."

each smaller piece, there are 26  26  26 = 263 possible outcomes.
"
13956,"The product principle does not require that each piece that is being combined be
chosen from a set of the same size."
13957,"We will use this observation to create a standard
way to count outcomes when the pieces are chosen from a fixed set, but without
allowing for any piece to be used more than once."

many 3-letter words there are that contain distinct letters.

"
14046,"Note that it doesnt make sense to ask for the number of bections
here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger than the domain, there
are no surjections)."
14047,"But for a function to be injective, we just cant use an
element of the codomain more than once.
"
14048,We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1.

are 8 choices."

Example 3.4.8
Your basketball team has 12 players."

position, how many ways can you choose 5 players to be on the court at the
same time?
Solution.
"
14058,This question is actually too vague.
14059,"Do we mean how many ways
can we select five players?"
14060,"Or do we mean how many ways can we pick five
players to fill the five positions?2 Lets answer both of these questions.
"

Wait."

five players first, we have 12 choices for the point guard, then 11 choices for
the shooting guard, and so on."
14070,"So the total number of ways to pick five players
for the five positions is simply the permutation
(12, 5) = 12  11  10  9  8 = 95, 040.

3003 "
14114,"6! choices and that is exactly 2162160.
"
14115,"Alternatively, look at the first problem another way."
14116,"We want to select 6
out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in."
14117,"To
select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:
14  13  12  11  10  9.
"
14118,"This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then
13 for the second, and so on."
14119,"But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is
exactly 2162160 = (14, 6))."
14120,"It distinguishes between the different orders in
which we could invite the guests."
14121,"To correct for this, we could divide by the
number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would
count as just one outcome)."
14122,"There are precisely 6! ways to arrange 6 guests, so
the correct answer to the first question is
14  13  12  11  10  9

which is what we had originally.

14125,Perhaps combination is a misleading label.
14126,"We dont mean it like a combination
lock (where the order would definitely matter)."
14127,"Perhaps a better metaphor is a
combination of flavors  you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the
order in which to combine them.
"
14128,"So how do you know when to use a combination and when to use a permutation?
"
14129,"Does order matter?
"
14130,"Almost every source you look at about combinations and
permutations will make some variation of the following claim.
"
14131,"Use a permutation when the order matters, and use a combination when
the order does not matter.
"
14132,What does this even mean?
14133,"And why is it an absolutely awful way to distinguish
between the two counting techniques?"
14134,"Lets explore with an example.
"
14135,Suppose you are proposing a new lottery game.

balls will be randomly shot out of the machine that holds balls numbered 1 to 50."
14137,"If

238
3."
14138,"Counting
a player correctly picks the five numbers that come out, they win the jackpot.
"
14139,"Of course, we want to know the odds of winning this lottery game, which
requires us to know how many different outcomes there are."
14140,"The balls fly out of the
machine randomly, so one result might be to get the balls
26, 5, 42, 17, 33.
"
14141,"If you were holding the ticket that had numbers 5, 17, 26, 33, 47, do you expect
to have won?"
14142,"Most lottery games would say you have, since you have the same
numbers, just in a different order.
"
14143,"In this sense, the order of the numbers does not matter."
14144,"A better way to say this is
that any order of the same numbers is considered the same outcome, and is counted
only once."
14145,"So really, we are counting the sets of five numbers, not the sequences of
five numbers."
14146,"Each outcome is a combination, so the number of outcomes should
be (52, 5) =  52
5

.
"
14147,"On the other hand, if we must pick the numbers in the same order they come out
of the machine, then we are really matching a sequence of numbers to a sequence of
numbers."
14148,"The number of sequences is (52, 5)."
14149,"In this case, we would say that the
order matters.
"
14150,"Okay, so far so good."
14151,"But what about the following example?
Example 3.4.11
How many three letter words are there in which
1."
14152,"the letters appear in alphabetical order?
"
14153,"2. the letters in the word can come in any order?
Solution.
"
14154,Does order matter for the first question?
14155,"In some sense, abso-
lutely!"
14156,"We only want to count words where the letters are in the correct order.
"
14157,"But from the standard combination/permutation sense of order mattering, it
does not.
"
14158,"Much better would be to ask ourselves whether we should represent each
outcome as a set of letters or a sequence of letters."
14159,"It is true that words are a
sequence of letters, but are we counting all possible sequences?"
14160,"Nope, just
one sequence for each set of letters."
14161,"Ah, yes, set of letters."
14162,"Each outcome
corresponds exactly to one set of three letters."
14163,"We are counting sets, so we
count combinations."
14164,"The number of outcomes is (26, 3) =  26
3

.
"
14165,"For the second question, it might look like the order shouldnt matter.
"
14166,"Well, it doesnt matter to the machine spitting out the letters, but it would
matter if we were trying to match the letters."
14167,"No, lets think about it like
this: Are we counting every possible sequence of letters?"
14168,"So these are
permutations, and the number of outcomes is (26, 3).
"
14169,Another deceptive use of order appears when counting bit strings.
14170,"Recall that
an -bit string of weight is a string of bits (0s and 1s) in which of the bits are 1s.

"
14171,"Combinations and Permutations
239
For example, the 4-bit strings of weight 2 are
1100, 1010, 1001, 0110, 0101, 0011.
"
14172,Does order matter for bit strings?
14173,Of course it does!
14174,"It is the only thing that matters.
"
14175,"All of the strings above contain exactly the same number of 0s and 1s; they are only
distinguished by the order of the bits.
"
14176,"And yet, the number of -bit strings of weight is  


and NOT a permutation.
"
14177,"What is going on here?
"
14178,"Nothing is broken; we are just not thinking about the right objects about which
to consider the order."
14179,"When we choose out of things for a bit string, it is the
positions we are choosing (to fill with 1s, say)."
14180,"It does not matter in what order we
choose those positions, just what set of positions we choose."
14181,"That is, the bit string
1001 is the result of choosing positions 1 and 4 to put 1s into."
14182,"If we chose positions 4
and then 1, we would get the same bit string.
"
14183,"To summarize, the question of whether order matters can lead us astray when
deciding between a combination and a permutation."
14184,"Instead, we should decide
whether the outcomes we are counting are sets or sequences."
14185,"If we are counting
sets, think combination."
14186,"If we are counting sequences, think permutation.

Look at the first row."
14196,What do all these permutations have in common?
14197,"These
are exactly the permutations that use the letters , , in different orders."
14198,"It is
not surprising that there are 6 of these, since the number of ways to arrange three
elements is 3!"
14199,"Similarly, the second row has 6 permutations that use the letters
, , in different orders, and so on.
"
14200,"The point is, if we wanted to just count how many sets of three of the four letters
we have, each set corresponds exactly to one of the rows in the table."
14201,"There are 24
elements in the table, and 6 elements in each row, so there must be 24  6 = 4 rows.
"
14202,"And of course, we are not surprised because  4

= 4.
A more mathematically rigorous explanation for this phenomenon is to use the
language of equivalence relations and partitions from Section 2.6."
14203,"We start with
permutations, and then we define an equivalence relation on the permutations by
saying two permutations are equivalent provided they contain exactly the same
elements."
14204,"From the equivalence relation we get a partition of our set of permutations
into equivalence classes.
"
14205,"The combinations we want to count are precisely the
equivalence classes."
14206,"Since each equivalence class has the same size, we can find the
number of classes by dividing the number of permutations by the size of each class.
"
14207,"This sort of quotient principle is also useful for solving questions where the
answer isnt obviously either a permutation or combination.
"
14208,"Example 3.4.12
You have decided to decorate your magic wand with bands of different colored
tape."
14209,"You have 10 different colors to choose from, and you will use five of them
to create five different stripes of color."
14210,"How many different wand designs are
possible?
Solution.
"
14211,"Our first attempt to solve this problem might be to think of each
outcome we are trying to count as a 5-permutation of 10 colors."
14212,"That would
give us an answer of (10, 5) = 10  9  8  7  6 = 30, 240."
14213,"So why is this not
correct?"
14214,"Lets start making a list of the outcomes that are possible.
"
14215,"Red, blue, green, yellow, orange.
"
14216,"2. Red, blue, green, yellow, purple.
"
14217,"3. Blue, green, red, yellow, orange.
"
14218,"Orange, yellow, green, blue, red.
5. etc.
While starting this list, perhaps we asked ourselves whether red, red, blue,
blue, red should be on the list, and recognized that it shouldnt."
14219,"Another
thing we might have considered is whether items 1 and 3 are really different.
"
14220,"They are, since one wand has red as an outside color while the other one does
not.

But what about items 1 and 4?"
14222,"They have the same five colors, but in
a different order."
14223,"However, if you were to spin the magic wand around,
like magicians are apt to do, you could easily end up with wand 4 from
wand 1."
14224,"We see that each wand is counted exactly twice in our list of
permutations: two permutations are equivalent if they are just the reverse of
each other.
"
14225,"Since we can group the permutations into groups of size 2, and each group
corresponds to a single wand, we see that the correct answer is,

What we want to count are some sort of set-like structure but one that does permit
elements in the set to appear more than once"

"
14305,"Definition 3.5.1
A multiset is an unordered collection of elements, each of which can appear
any number of times."
14306,"The number of times an element appears is called its
multiplicity.

list in braces, such as {1, 2, 2, 5}.

range of counting problems."

Have Some Cookies
Consider the following counting problem:
You have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids."
14321,"How many ways can you do this?
Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem."
14322,"You may assume
that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies."
14323,"Also, the cookies are all identical and
the order in which you give out the cookies does not matter (so giving cookies to the
second kid before the first kid does not count as a separate outcome as th"
14324,"Before solving the problem, here is a wrong answer: You might guess that the
answer should be 47 because, for each of the 7 cookies, there are 4 choices of kids to
which you can give the cookie."
14325,"This is reasonable, but wrong."
14326,"To see why, consider
a few possible outcomes: We could assign the first six cookies to kid A, and the
seventh cookie to kid B. Another outcome would assign the first cookie to kid B and
the six remain"
14327,"Both outcomes are included in the 47 answer.
"
14328,"But for our counting problem, both outcomes are really the same  kid A gets six
cookies and kid B gets one cookie."
14329,"This would have been the correct answer if the
cookies were all different, but they are not.
"
14330,What do outcomes actually look like?
14331,How can we represent them?
14332,"One
approach would be to write an outcome as a string of four numbers like this:
3112,

3.5."
14333,"Counting Multisets
247
which represents the outcome in which the first kid gets 3 cookies, the second and
third kids each get 1 cookie, and the fourth kid gets 2 cookies."
14334,"Represented this
way, the order in which the numbers occur matters."
14335,"1312 is a different outcome,
because the first kid gets one cookie instead of 3."
14336,"Each number in the string can
be any integer between 0 and 7."
14337,But the answer is not 74.
14338,"We need the sum of the
numbers to be 7.
Another way we might represent outcomes is to write a string of seven letters:
ABAADCD,
which represents that the first cookie goes to kid A, the second cookie "
14339,"In fact, this outcome is identical
to the previous oneA gets 3 cookies, B and C get 1 each, and D gets 2."
14340,"Each of
the seven letters in the string can be any of the 4 possible letters (one for each kid),
but the number of such strings is not 47, because here order does not matter."
14341,"In fact,
another way to write the same outcome is
AAABCDD.
"
14342,This will be the preferred representation of the outcome.
14343,"Since we can write
the letters in any order, we might as well write them in alphabetical order for the
purposes of counting."
14344,"So we will write all the As first, then all the Bs, and so on."
14345,"In
fact, since we do not distinguish between the different arrangements, it is like we are
writing a set, just that this multiset can contain an element more than one time.
"
14346,"So we now have two useful ways to think of the outcomes.
"
14347,"As a multiset containing 7 elements, each of which is one of the four kids (or
letter representing their names)."
14348,"For example,
{, , , , , , }.
"
14349,"Each time a kid is in the multiset, it means that kid gets a cookie, so the
multiplicity of the kid in the multiset is the number of cookies the kid gets.
"
14350,As a string of 4 non-negative numbers with a sum of 7.
14351,"For example,
3112.
"
14352,"The position of the number in the string represents the kid, and the number
itself represents the number of cookies that kid gets.
"
14353,"Before we think about how to count the number of outcomes represented this
way, here are a couple more examples of counting problems we can represent in
these ways.

14354,"Counting
Example 3.5.2
You grab a handful of ten jelly beans from a bag that contains six flavors."
14355,"Write
down three possible outcomes using both multisets and strings of numbers.
"
14356,"Multisets are the more natural way to think of this problem since
each handful is a multiset of flavors."
14357,"So for example we could have,
{, , , , , , , , , }
meaning you got two red, three green, four blue, and one yellow jelly bean
(and no purple or orange), or
{, , , , , , , , , }
which means you got ten"
14358,"You could also have
{, , , , , , , , , }
meaning you have one each of red, green, blue, and yellow, and five orange
jelly beans.
"
14359,"The corresponding sequences of six numbers summing to 10 are
2, 3, 4, 1, 0, 0;
10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0;
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5.
"
14360,"(We added commas between numbers since not every number is a single
digit.)"
14361,"Notice that for this representation we need to agree on a fixed order of
the flavors, which was not alphabetical in this case, but the same order we
used when listing the multisets.
"
14362,"Example 3.5.3
You have 12 identical copies of your favorite Discrete Math book that you
want to put on 5 bookshelves."
14363,"Write down three possible outcomes using
both multisets and strings of numbers.
Solution.
"
14364,"Here the sequences of numbers are more natural, since we can
just say how many books go on each shelf."
14365,"We will need 5 numbers that add
up to 12."
14366,"For example, we could have
1. 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, meaning 3 books on the first shelf, 3 on the second, 3 on the
third, 2 on the fourth, and 1 on the fifth.
"
14367,"2. 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, meaning all 12 books are on the middle shelf.
"
14368,"3. 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, meaning one book on each of the first four shelves and 8 on
the last.

times, shelf 2 is assigned a book three times, etc."
14372,"Notice that there are 12
elements in the multiset, one for each book."
14373,"The numbers here represent
the shelves; the multiplicity of the number is the number of books on
that shelf.
"
14374,"2. {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}."
14375,"The only shelf in the multiset is shelf 3,
with multiplicity 12, meaning that shelf 3 gets 12 books.
"
14376,"3. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5}."
14377,"Here shelf 1 gets one book, shelf 2 gets one
book, shelf 3 gets one book, shelf 4 gets one book, and shelf 5 gets the
rest.
"
14378,"This last example could also have been asked as a question about solving
equations with non-negative integer solutions."
14379,"In particular, we could have asked
for solutions to the equation + + + + = 12."
14380,"Think of each variable as saying
how many books go on each shelf."
14381,"We will ask questions directly like this, but
realizing how to represent other questions as such an equation can be useful.
"
14382,"3.5.3
Representing Multisets with Bit Strings
Now lets return to the original problem of distributing 7 cookies to 4 kids and
actually count the number of outcomes.
"
14383,"When we were counting plain old sets, we saw that the numbers in Pascals
triangle gave us the counts."
14384,"In fact, we saw this was true because we could represent
each set as a bit string."
14385,"Whenever an element was in the set, we would denote that
with a 1, and if the element was not in the set, we would mark its absence with a 0.
"
14386,"This is essentially what we did with multisets but had to use strings of non-
negative numbers beyond just 0 and 1, since an element in a multiset can appear
more than 0 or 1 times."
14387,"But if we could translate those strings of numbers into some
other sort of bit string, then we could use Pascals triangle to count the number of
multisets.
"
14388,Here is how we can do this.
14389,"Given a multiset such as
{, , , , , , }
we have a number sequence representation as
3, 1, 1, 2.
"
14390,"Well, instead of individual numbers, write each as a sequence of that many 1s."
14391,"So
this example becomes
111, 1, 1, 11.
"
14392,This is slightly awkward since we are using commas to separate the numbers.
14393,"To
make this clearer, lets switch to two different symbols."
14394,"We will call them sticks and

250
3."
14395,"Counting
stones, where the stone represents a 1 and the stick represents a comma."
14396,"So the
sequence
111, 1, 1, 11
becomes
| | | .
"
14397,"This is a string of ten symbols, 7 of which are stones and 3 of which are sticks.
"
14398,This is fantastic!
14399,"Whatever two symbols we use (you might also see these called
stars and bars or balls and bins), we can use Pascals triangle to count the number
of ways to arrange them."
14400,"The number of 10-bit strings of weight 3 (or weight 7) is
 10
3

= 120.
"
14401,"In terms of cookies, we can view this sticks and stones diagram as saying after
how many cookies we stop giving cookies to the first kid and start giving cookies to
the second kid."
14402,And then after how many do we switch to the third kid?
14403,"And after
how many do we switch to the fourth?"
14404,"So
| | | 
means three cookies go to the first kid; then we switch and give one cookie to the
second kid, then switch, one to the third kid, switch, two to the fourth kid."
14405,"Notice
that we need 7 stones and 3 sticks  one stone for each cookie, and one stick for each
switch between kids, so one fewer sticks than there are kids (we dont need to switch
after the last kid  we"
14406,"While we are at it, we can also answer a related question: How many ways are
there to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids so that each kid gets at least one cookie?"
14407,"What
can you say about the corresponding sticks and stones charts?"
14408,"The charts must start
and end with at least one stone (so that kids A and D) get cookies, and also no two
sticks can be adjacent (so that kids B and C are not skipped)."
14409,"One way to ensure
this is to place sticks only in the spaces between the stones."
14410,"With 7 stones, there are
6 spots between the stones, so we must choose 3 of those 6 spots to fill with bars.
"
14411,"Thus there are  6
3

ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids giving at least one cookie to
each kid.
"
14412,"Another (and more general) way to approach this modified problem is to first
give each kid one cookie."
14413,"Now the remaining 3 cookies can be distributed to the 4
kids without restrictions."
14414,"So we have 3 stones and 3 sticks for a total of 6 symbols,
3 of which must be bars."
14415,"So again we see that there are  6
3
 ways to distribute the
cookies.
"
14416,"Sticks and stones can be used in counting problems other than kids and cookies.
"
14417,"Here are a few examples:
Example 3.5.4
Your favorite mathematical ice cream parlor offers 10 flavors."
14418,"How many
milkshakes could you create using exactly 6, not necessarily distinct scoops?
"
14419,"The order you add the flavors does not matter (they will be blended up anyway),

3.5."
14420,"Counting Multisets
251
"
14421,but you are allowed repeats.
14422,"So one possible shake is triple chocolate, double
cherry, and mint chocolate chip.
"
14423,"We get six scoops, each of which could be one of ten possible
flavors."
14424,Represent each scoop as a star.
14425,"Think of going down the counter one
flavor at a time: You see vanilla first, and skip to the next, chocolate."
14426,"You

flavor."
14427,"You keep skipping until you get to cherry, which you say yes to twice.
"
14428,Another switch and you are at mint chocolate chip.

"
14687,The tricky thing is coming up with the question.
14688,"This is not always obvious, but
it gets easier the more counting problems you solve."
14689,"You will start to recognize
types of answers as the answers to types of questions."
14690,"More often what will happen
is that you will be solving a counting problem and happen to think up two different
ways of finding the answer."
14691,"Now you have a binomial identity, and the proof is right
there."
14692,"The proof is the problem you just solved together with your two solutions.
"
14693,"For example, consider this counting question:
How many 10-letter words use exactly four As, three Bs, two Cs, and
one D?
"
14694,Lets try to solve this problem.
14695,We have 10 spots for letters to go.
14696,"Four of those need
to be As."
14697,"We can pick the four A-spots in  10

ways."
14698,"Now where can we put the Bs?
"
14699,Well there are only 6 spots left; we need to pick 3 of them.
14700,"This can be done in  6

ways."
14701,"The two Cs need to go in two of the 3 remaining spots, so we have  3

ways of
doing that."
14702,"That leaves just one spot of the D, but we could write that 1 choice as  1

"
14715,"To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question
we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand side of the
identity, and the other way needs to be the right-hand side of t"
14716,"Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right-hand side:  +2

counts
the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of + 2 things."
14717,"Lets
name those things 1, 2, 3, . . ."
14718,", + 2."
14719,"In other words, we want to find 3-element
subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly
the right thing to think about)."
14720,"We will have to be a bit clever to explain why
the left-hand side also gives the number of these subsets."
14721,"Heres the proof.
"
14722,"Proof.
Consider the question How many 3-element subsets are there of the
set {1, 2, 3, . . ."
14723,", + 2}?"
14724,"We answer this in two ways:
Answer 1: We must select 3 elements from the collection of + 2 elements.
"
14725,"This can be done in  +2
3

ways.
"
14726,"Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number
in the subset is."
14727,"Say each subset is {, , } written in increasing order."
14728,"We
count the number of subsets for each distinct value of ."
14729,"The smallest possible
value of is 2, and the largest is + 1.
"
14730,"When = 2, there are 1  subsets: 1 choice for and choices (3 through
+ 2) for .
"
14731,"When = 3, there are 2  (1) subsets: 2 choices for and 1 choices
for .
"
14732,"When = 4, there are 3  (2) subsets: 3 choices for and 2 choices
for .
And so on."
14733,"When = + 1, there are choices for and only 1 choice for
, so  1 subsets.
"
14734,"Therefore the total number of subsets is
1+ 2(1) + 3(2) +    + (1)2 + 1.
"
14735,"Since Answer 1 and Answer 2 are answers to the same question, they must
be equal."

14764,"How many paths pass through (0, )?"

Investigate!
Suppose you, like the 17th-century French nobleman Chevalier de Mere,
liked gambling on the outcome of rolling fair 6-sided dice (each numbered
1 to 6)."
14878,"Would you bet him that he couldnt roll at least one 6 in four rolls of
a single die?"
14879,"What about betting that he couldnt roll at least one double-6
in 24 rolls of both dice?
"
14880,"To make these decisions, we should decide
1."
14881,"How likely is it that in four rolls of a single die, there will be at least
one 6?
2."
14882,"How likely is it that in 24 rolls of two dice, there will be at least one
double-6?
3."
14883,"Since the ratio 4 : 6 is equal to the ratio 24 : 36, should the probability of
these events be the same?"
14884,"Thats what the Chevalier de Mere thought.
"
14885,Here is a python script that can help you get a feel for the questions above.
14886,"You
can switch between the two questions by commenting and uncommenting out the
appropriate lines (lines that start with a # are comments)."
14887,"See how lucky you are!
"
14888,"import random

die = random.randint (1,6)

die1 = random.randint (1,6)
#
die2 = random.randint (1,6)

"
14890,"If you know some python, you might want to modify the script to run the
experiment 1000 times and see how many of those are wins.
"
14891,"We can get a feel for probability empirically by observing how frequently events
occur when an experiment is repeated many times."
14892,"It often happens, as it did with
the Chevalier de Mere, that our intuition about probability is not quite right."
14893,"Using
the counting techniques we have studied, we can explain why our intuition is off
and what the true probabilities are.
"
14894,"Most of the questions about counting we have considered in this chapter can
also be asked as a question about probability."
14895,"For example: How many passwords
of length 8 can you make using just lower-case letters?"
14896,"What is the probability that
randomly selecting 8 lower-case letters will give you your password?
"
14897,"While the subject of probability is vast and complex, the basics of discrete
probability are little more than counting."
14898,"So here we will take a brief look at how
our study of counting can help us understand probability.
"
14899,"Preview Activity
Suppose you were in a class of 30 students."
14900,"How likely is it that at least two of the
students were born on the same day of the year?
Assume that all days are equally likely and that nobody was born on February
29th."
14901,Would you believe the answer is more than 25%?
14902,More than 50%?
14903,"More than
70%???"
14904,"Lets find the answer.
"
14905,"First, what should we mean by probability?"
14906,"If you roll a fair six-sided die,
what is the probability of rolling a 6?
"
14907,"What is the probability of rolling an even number?
2.
We will define the probability of an event as the number of ways the event can
happen divided by the total number of things that can happen.
"
14908,(a) Suppose you roll two dice (one red and one green).
14909,"How many total
outcomes are there?
(b) Of those outcomes, how many have different numbers on the two dice?
Hint.
"
14910,"How many sequences of two different numbers can you make
using the numbers 1 to 6?
(c)"
14911,"Combining the two numbers your found above, what is the probability
that two dice will show different numbers?
(d)"
14912,"What is the probability that you will get three different numbers when
rolling three dice?"
14913,"(Assume the dice are different colors).

Now to birthdays."
14915,"There are 365 days in a year.
"
14916,"(a) How many possible sequences of 30 birthdays are there?
(b) How many possible sequences of 30 birthdays contain no repeats?
"
14917,"(c) What is the probability that 30 people have no repeated birthdays?
(d) Among the 30 people, either they all have different birthdays or at least
two share a birthday."
14918,"Since this is certain, its probability is 1."
14919,"So what is
the probability that at least two people (out of the 30) share a birthday?
(e) What is the smallest number of people you would need to have a greater
than 90% chance that at least two share"
14920,"We
might say that tossing a coin has a 50% chance of coming up heads."
14921,"Or that when
rolling two dice, having the sum of the dice result in a 7 is more likely than having
the sum be a 2."
14922,"Casinos certainly rely on certain pairs of cards being consistently
more likely than others when setting payouts for Blackjack."
14923,"All of this assumes that
there is some randomness to events, and that even in this randomness, there is some
consistency to what can happen."
14924,"We will assume this model of reality.
"
14925,The things we can assign probabilities to are called random experiments.
14926,"These
can have different possible outcomes."
14927,"We will call the (finite) set of possible outcomes
to a random experiment the sample space (we will usually denote this set as ).
"
14928,"By definition, performing a random experiment will always result in exactly one
outcome from the sample space.
"
14929,"Throughout this section, we will always assume the uniform probability dis-
tribution, which means that we insist that each outcome in the sample space is
equally likely."
14930,"Then the probability of any particular outcome in the sample space 
is exactly
1
||.
"
14931,"The uniform probability distribution is a common and reasonable
assumption to make, but it does preclude us from asking some questions.
"
14932,"For example, throwing a dart at a dartboard is not uniformly distributed,
and similarly, rolling weighted dice would not be."
14933,"What is the probability
that a thumbtack lands point up?"
14934,"But how would we even start to answer
these questions?"
14935,"We would have to make some assumptions about what
the probabilities of the outcomes actually are (perhaps via some repeated
experiments).
"
14936,"There are other reasons to study different probability distributions, and
this is a major topic of study in a course in probability theory.

"
14937,"Counting
Example 3.7.2
Suppose you flip two fair coins (a penny and a nickel)."
14938,"What is the sample
space of possible outcomes?"
14939,"What is the probability of getting two heads?
Solution.
"
14940,"The same space is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment,
which in this case is the set {, , , }."
14941,"The probability of getting
two heads is then 1
4."
14942,"In fact, every outcome has probability 1
4 since there are 4
outcomes in the sample space.
"
14943,Finding probabilities of outcomes really is this easy.
14944,"Where things get more fun
is if we look for the probability of an event: a subset of the sample space."
14945,"For a
particular random experiment, there might be lots of different events we ask about,
and they do not need to be mutually exclusive."
14946,"An event can also be a set containing
just a single outcome or might contain no outcomes.
"
14947,"For example, suppose you roll a fair 6-side die."
14948,"The sample space contains six
outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
14949,"Some events we might care about include rolling an even
number (the subset {2, 4, 6}), rolling a number less than 3 (the set {1, 2}), or rolling
a number less than 10 (the subset {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})."
14950,"In fact, we now know that there
are exactly 26 = 64 different events we could ask about, since there are 64 subsets of
the sample space.
"
14951,"What does our intuition suggest about the example events described above?
"
14952,"Rolling an even number should be just as likely as rolling an odd number, so we
hope that the probability of rolling an even number is 1
2."
14953,"Similarly, the probability of
rolling a number less than 3 should be 1
3 since a third of the possible outcomes are
less than 3."
14954,What about rolling a number less than 10?
14955,"Well, this must happen, so it
would be 100%, which as a fraction is just 1.
"
14956,"Consistent with our intuition, we define the probability of an event as follows.
"
14957,"Definition 3.7.3
Suppose a random experiment has sample space . The probability of an
event is the number of outcomes in divided by the number of outcomes
in . We write this as () = ||
||.
"
14958,"Example 3.7.4
Suppose you roll a regular 6-sided die (each side contains a number from 1 to
6)."
14959,"What is the probability that you will roll an even number?
Solution.
"
14960,"The sample space is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} of possible rolls."
14961,"The
event, call it for even, is the set of outcomes {2, 4, 6}."
14962,"Thus the probability
of occurring is
()"
14963,"= 3
6 = 1
2.

3.7."
14964,"Applications to Probability
277
We have spent a lot of effort learning how to count the size of sets."
14965,"We can then
use this to compute probabilities by counting the size of the sample space (set) and
the size of the event (set).
"
14966,"Example 3.7.5
If you draw 5 cards from a regular deck of 52 cards, what is the probability
that you will draw 4-of-a-kind?
Solution.
"
14967,"First, lets count the sample space, which will consist of all 5-card
hands."
14968,"The order of the cards in a hand is not important, so we will just count
5-element subsets of the 52 cards."
14969,"The sample space therefore contains  52
5

elements."
14970,"(This number is just under 2.6 million: 2, 598, 960 to be exact.)
"
14971,"Now, how many of those will be 4-of-a-kind?"
14972,"One way we could count
this would be to first select which of the 13 values will be the 4-of-a-kind,
which can be done in  13
1

= 13 ways."
14973,"What about the other card in the hand?
"
14974,"Well, there are 48 other cards it could be, so the number of 4-of-a-kind hands
is 13  48 = 624.
"
14975,"This makes the probability of getting 4-of-a-kind,
(4-of-a-kind) = 13  48
 52
5

0.00024.
"
14976,An important subtlety:
14977,"Whenever counting the size of the sample space and the
event, we must make sure that we are really counting the number of elements of
the sample space that are in the event."
14978,"In particular, if we count subsets of cards
in the sample space (using a combination instead of using a permutation to count
sequences of cards) then we must count the number of subsets of cards in th"
14979,"Interestingly, we can find the probability of getting 4-of-a-kind using permuta-
tions too: The number of 5-card sequences is (52, 5) = 311, 875, 200."
14980,"Finding the
number of 4-of-a-kind sequences is a little more complicated."
14981,"There are 13 possible
values for the 4-of-a-kind, and 48 remaining cards for the fifth card."
14982,"But those five
cards can be arranged in 5! different ways."
14983,"So the number of 4-of-a-kind sequences
is 13  48  5!."
14984,"This gives,
(4-of-a-kind) = 13  48  5!
(52, 5)
0.00024.
Is this close to the same answer we had before?"
14985,"It is exactly the same (we can verify
this by noticing the extra 5! in both the numerator and denominator).
"
14986,"While picking between combinations and permutations (as long as you pick the
same for both the sample space and the event) will give you the same probability, this
is not always true, as you are asked"
14987,"Counting
3.7.3
Probability Rules
Here are a few basic probability facts that follow easily from our definition of
probability and understanding of counting."
14988,"While we are still under the assumption
that the outcomes in the sample space are equally likely (the uniform probability
distribution), these rules will hold for all probability distributions.
"
14989,"First, we often are interested in the probability that an event does not occur."
14990,"We
call this the complement of the event."
14991,"Remember, events are subsets of the sample
space, and not being in the event means you are in the complement of that subset.
"
14992,"Using the same notation we have for sets, the complement of an event will be
written"
14993,". Here is the relationship between the probability of an event and its
complement.
"
14994,"Theorem 3.7.6
The probability of the complement of an event is
() = 1 ().
"
14995,"Remember that () = ||
||, the number of outcomes in the event divided
by the total number of outcomes."
14996,But how many outcomes are not in ?
14997,"All the
others."
14998,"That is,

 = || || .
"
14999,"So for sure, we have
() =


|| = || ||
||
= ||
|| ||
|| = 1 ().
"
15000,"Lets illustrate this proof with an example.
"
15001,"Example 3.7.7
Suppose you flip a fair coin 10 times."
15002,"What is the probability that you will get
at least one heads?
Solution.
"
15003,"There are lots of ways you can get at least one head, but only one
way you can get no heads (that is, get all tails)."
15004,"So it makes sense to try to
compute the requested probability as the complement of a probability easier
to compute.
"
15005,The sample space here is the set of all 10-toss sequences.
15006,"How many are
there?"
15007,"For each term in the sequence, it could be a head (H) or tail (T), so
there are 210 = 1024 possible sequences.
"
15008,We want to find the probability of getting at least one head.
15009,"Lets think of
this just as a counting question: How many 10-toss sequences have at least
one head?"
15010,"All 1024 of them, except the one all tails sequence."
15011,"So there are

3.7."
15012,"Applications to Probability
279
1023 sequences with at least one head."
15013,"Thus the probability of getting at least
one head is 1023
1024.
"
15014,"Wait, did we use Theorem 3.7.6?"
15015,"Not explicitly, but essentially we have.
"
15016,"Using the theorem, we would have said that the probability of getting at least
one head is
1 (all tails)"
15017,"= 1 
1
1024 = 1023
1024.
"
15018,"Note that the calculation we did required subtracting fractions:
1 
1
1024 = 1024
1024 
1
1024 = 1024 1
1024
= 1023
1024.
"
15019,"So whether we do the subtraction to calculate the size of the complement, or
use the complement formula and subtract fractions, we get the same answer.
"
15020,"Complementary probabilities are very useful when answering historical questions
about dice.
"
15021,"What is the probability that you will roll at least one 6 in four rolls of a fair
6-sided die?
"
15022,"Is this the same as the probability that you will roll at least one double 6
in 24 rolls of two dice?
Solution.
"
15023,"The complementary event is rolling a die four times and never
getting a 6."
15024,"Of the 64 possible rolls, there are 54 that contain no 6."
15025,"So the
probability of getting at least one 6 in four rolls is
(at least one 6) = 1 (no 6) = 1 54
64 0.5177.
"
15026,"For the double 6 in 24 rolls variant, we use the complementary event as
well: what is the probability of not getting double 6s?"
15027,"That means on every
roll you get one of the 35 other pairs.
"
15028,"(at least one double 6) = 1 (no double 6) = 1 3524
3624 0.4914.
"
15029,"Indeed, the Chevalier de Mere noticed that when playing the game with
two dice, he tended to lose money in the long run."
15030,"Who did he turn to to ask
for help?"
15031,"Blaise Pascal, of course!
"
15032,"Another way to think about complementary probabilities is to say that
() + () = 1.
A probability of 1 means the event is certain, so perhaps we should think of this as

280
3."
15033,"Counting
giving the probability that event either happened or didnt happen."
15034,"This is exactly
what we want to mean by adding probabilities.
"
15035,"Theorem 3.7.9
Suppose and are two disjoint events."
15036,"Then the probability of either or 
happening is,
() = () + ().
"
15037,"If and are not disjoint, then the probability of or occurring is,
() = ()"
15038,"+ () ().
"
15039,The proof of this fact is one of the exercises in this section.
15040,"However, it should
become clear how this works with an example.
"
15041,"Example 3.7.10
Suppose you roll a fair 6-sided die."
15042,"What is the probability of rolling a number
that is even or less than 3 ?
Solution.
"
15043,We dont need a theorem to answer this.
15044,"The sample space is
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the event is the subset = {1, 2, 4, 6}."
15045,"So () = 4
6.
To see where the 4 comes from, let be the event of rolling an even
number (so = {2, 4, 6}) and be the event of rolling a number less than 3
(so = {1, 2})."
15046,"Notice that the notation () = () makes sense, since
as sets, we really do have = .
If we go back to the definition of the probability of an event, we have,
() = ||
|| = ||
||
.
"
15047,We must find the size of the set .
15048,"But we know how to find the size of
the union of non-disjoint sets: use PIE!"
15049,"So || = 3 + 2 1 = 4.
"
15050,"As the example demonstrates, we have basically translated the sum principle
into the language of probability."
15051,"Can we do the same for the product principle?
"
15052,"We use the product principle to find the number of ways two events can both
happen, one after the other."
15053,"Many probability questions ask for the probability of
such compound events."
15054,"Lets consider an example to see what is going on.
"
15055,"Example 3.7.11
What is the probability of getting an even number when rolling a 6-sided die
and a heads when flipping a coin?
Solution.
"
15056,First we will find the probability directly from the definition.
15057,"Applications to Probability
281
sample space consists of all pairs of outcomes from the die and the coin, so =
{(1, ), (1, ), (2, ), (2, ), (3, ), (3, ), (4, ), (4, ), (5, ), (5, ), (6, ), (6, )}.
"
15058,"Without listing these, we could have calculated the size of the sample space
using the product principle: || = 6  2 = 12."
15059,"The event we are interested
in is the set of outcomes = {(2, ), (4, ), (6, )}."
15060,"Obviously that is size 3,
which we could have also found as 3  1."
15061,"So the probability of this event is
()"
15062,"= 3
12 = 1
4.
Now consider the two events separately."
15063,"Say is rolling an even number,
and flipping the coin and getting heads."
15064,"The probability of the first event is
()"
15065,"= 3
6."
15066,"The probability of the second event is () = 1
2."
15067,"It appears that the
correct way to combine these probabilities is to multiply them:
() = (and ) = ()()"
15068,"= 3
6
1
2 = 1
4.
How convenient that multiplying fractions is done by multiplying the nu-
merators and denominators separately, and this is the same as applying the
product principle to the numerator "
15069,"The reason the above example worked out was that the events were independent.
"
15070,"Intuitively, this means that the outcome of the first event has no influence on the
outcome of the second event."
15071,"Actually, we use this principle like the product
principle to define independence.
"
15072,"Definition 3.7.12
Given two events and , we say that they are independent provided the
probability of both events happening is the product of the probabilities of
each event happening:
() = ()().
"
15073,"Notice that in the definition we describe the event that both and happen as
the intersection . Since events are sets, it makes sense to take an intersection.
"
15074,"The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are in both sets, which is
exactly what we want here.
"
15075,"This shines a light on a key difference between this definition and the product
principle."
15076,"We use the product principle to construct a new set of outcomes by
combining the outcomes in two sets."
15077,This creates new sorts of outcomes.
15078,"For
example, the product principle would combine the sets
{1, 2, 3} and {, } into {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}.
"
15079,"This is not the intersection of two sets (it is actually the Cartesian product:  =
{(, ) : ; })."
15080,"The definition of independence involves probabilities
relative to a fixed set of outcomes."
15081,"So the elements in and in the definition of
independence are already sequences like we would have created using the product

15082,"If we are more careful in Example 3.7.11 where we rolled a die and flipped a
coin, we should describe the event of first rolling an even number as the set

Conditional Probability
The famous probability problem, known as the Monty Hall problem, presents the
following conundrum."
15108,"You are on the game show Lets Make a Deal and will win
whatever is behind one of three doors you decide to open."
15109,"Behind one door is a
car; behind the other two are goats."
15110,"You pick a door, but before opening it, the host
(Monty Hall) reveals one of the other doors that has a goat behind it."
15111,"You then have
the opportunity to switch doors."
15112,Should you switch?
15113,"What is the probability of
getting the car if you do?
"
15114,By the way...
15115,"This problem was perhaps one of the first math problems to
go viral, although it did so when it appeared in the Sunday newspaper
magazine Parade."
15116,"After its publication, around 10,000 readers (including close
to 1000 with PhDs) wrote in complaining that the author, Marilyn vos Savant,
was wrong."
15117,"You might be tempted to say that the probability of getting the car when you
switch is 1
2."
15118,"After all, there are two doors left, and the car is behind one of them.
"
15119,"However, we must ask what the probability of getting the car is given that Monty
has revealed a goat behind another, unpicked door.
"
15120,"Definition 3.7.14
Given two events and , the conditional probability of given is,
(|) = ()
()

"
15121,"Does this definition agree with our intuition for what conditional probability
should mean?"
15122,Lets think about the sample space.

occurring under the assumption that has already occurred."
15124,"In other words, we
only care about the elements of the sample space that belong to .
If becomes the sample space, then the only outcomes from that can possibly
occur are the outcomes that are in and ."
15125,"So perhaps the definition of conditional

Phew."
15130,"Another crisis averted.
"
15131,"Example 3.7.15
Suppose you roll two 6-sided dice with your eyes closed."
15132,"Your friend says,
Hey look, at least one of your dice is a 4."
15133,"What is the probability that you
rolled a sum of 7?
Solution.
"
15134,"First note that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is 6
36 = 1
6, since
of the 36 pairs of numbers that can appear, there are six pairs that sum to
7: {(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1"
15135,"However, we are now in a situation
where at least one die is a 4."
15136,"This limits the sample space to the 11 pairs that
contain a 4 (we can count this using PIE as 6 + 6 1)."
15137,"Of these, only two sum
to 7: {(3, 4), (4, 3)}."
15138,"So the probability of rolling a sum of 7 given that one die
is a 4 is 2
11.
"
15139,"If we use the definition of conditional probability, we would compute this
slightly differently but arrive at the same answer."
15140,"We have events (the sum
is 7) and (at least one die is a 4)."
15141,"Then () = 11
36 and () =
2
36."
15142,"So
(|) = 2
11.
"
15143,"Notice that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 given that the red die is a 4
(say they are different colors) will be different!"
15144,"That would be 1
6, since we are
really just asking for the probability that the other die is a 3.
Example 3.7.16
Suppose you draw two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards."
15145,"What is the
probability that the second card is a face card given that the first card is red?
"
15146,"What is the probability that the first card is red given that the second card
is a face card?
Solution.
"
15147,"We have a sample space consisting of the 52  51 sequences of
two cards."
15148,"Event will be those pairs that have a red card as the first in
the sequence."
15149,"Event will be those pairs that have a face card second in the
sequence.
"
15150,"We are looking for both (|) and (|), so we will need to find (),
(), and ()."
15151,"There are 26  51 pairs in (select one of the 26 red cards,
and then any of the remaining 51 cards), so
() = 26  51
52  51 = 26

2.
"
15152,"There are 12  51 pairs in (select one of the 12 face cards, and then any of the

remaining 51 cards), so
() = 12  51
52  51 = 12
52 = 3
13.
"
15154,"Finding the size of the intersection is a little more challenging (we did so in
the subsection Combining Principles)."
15155,"There are 20  12 pairs that start with a
red, non-face card, and end with a face card, and another 6  11 pairs that start
with a red face card and end with a face card."
15156,"= 20  12 + 6  11
52  51

15162,"Look what happens when you clear the denominator in the definition of condi-

15333,"We could have found the answer much

that PIE works!

15341,"We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3

15343,"We can force kid

15344,"Doing
so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids

15345,"In that case, we have 7 stones (the 7 remaining

can this be accomplished?
"
15380,The advanced use of PIE has applications beyond sticks and stones.
15381,"A derange-
ment of elements {1, 2, 3, . . ."
15382,", } is a permutation in which no element is fixed.
"
15383,"For example, there are 6 permutations of the three elements {1, 2, 3}:

15384,"In fact, the only derangements of three

231 and 312.
"
15385,"If we go up to 4 elements, there are 24 permutations (because we have 4 choices

1 choice for the last)."
15386,How many of these are derangements?
15387,"If you list out all 24
permutations and eliminate those that are not derangements, you will be left with
just 9 derangements."

"
15389,"Example 3.8.4
How many derangements are there of 4 elements?
Solution.
"
15390,"We count all permutations and subtract those that are not derange-

15391,There are 4! = 24 permutations of 4 elements.

15437,"How many of the functions :
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are surjective?"
15438,"We have seen throughout this chapter that many counting questions can be
rephrased as questions about counting functions with certain properties."
15439,"This is
reasonable since many counting questions can be thought of as counting the number
of ways to assign elements from one set to elements of another.
"

"
15444,"You want to distribute your 8 different SNES games among 5 friends, so
that each friend gets at least one game?
"
15445,"In each case, model the counting question as a function counting question.
"
15446,"We must use the three games (call them 1, 2, 3) as the domain and the 5
friends (a,b,c,d,e) as the codomain (otherwise the function would not
be defined for the whole domain when a friend didnt get an"
15447,"So how many functions are there with domain {1, 2, 3} and codomain
{, , , , }?"
15448,"The answer to this is 53 = 125, since we can assign any of
5 elements to be the image of 1, any of 5 elements to be the image of 2
and any of 5 elements to be the image of 3.
"
15449,"But this is not the correct answer to our counting problem, because one
of these functions is =

; one friend can get more than one

298
3."
15450,What we really need to do is count injective functions.
15451,"This gives
(5, 3) = 60 functions, which is the answer to our counting question.
"
15452,"Again, we need to use the 8 games as the domain and the 5 friends as
the codomain."
15453,"We are counting all functions, so the number of ways to
distribute the games is 58.
"
15454,This question is harder.
15455,"Use the games as the domain and friends as the
codomain (the reverse would not give a function)."
15456,"To ensure that every
friend gets at least one game means that every element of the codomain
is in the range."
15457,"In other words, we are looking for surjective functions.
"
15458,"How do you count those?
"
15459,"In Example 3.2.13 we saw how to count all functions (using the multiplicative
principle) and in Example 3.4.7 we learned how to count injective functions (using
permutations)."
15460,"Surjective functions are not as easily counted (unless the size of the
domain is smaller than the codomain, in which case there are none).
"
15461,"The idea is to count the functions that are not surjective, and then subtract that
from the total number of functions."
15462,"This works very well when the codomain has
two elements in it:
"
15463,"Example 3.8.7
How many functions : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {, } are surjective?
Solution.
"
15464,"There are 25 functions total, two choices for where to send each
of the 5 elements of the domain."
15465,"Now of these, the functions that are not
surjective must exclude one or more elements of the codomain from the range.
"
15466,"So first, consider functions for which is not in the range."
15467,"This can only
happen one way: Everything gets sent to ."
15468,"Alternatively, we could exclude 
from the range."
15469,"Then everything gets sent to , so there is only one function
like this."
15470,"These are the only ways in which a function could not be surjective
(no function excludes both and from the range) so there are exactly 25 2
surjective functions.
"
15471,"When there are three elements in the codomain, there are now three choices for
a single element to exclude from the range."
15472,"Additionally, we could pick pairs of two
elements to exclude from the range, and we must make sure we dont overcount
these."
15473,"Its PIE time!
"
15474,"Example 3.8.8
How many functions : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {, , } are surjective?
Solution.
"
15475,"Again start with the total number of functions: 35 (as each of the
five elements of the domain can go to any of three elements of the codomain).

"
15476,"Advanced Counting Using PIE
299
"
15477,"Now we count the functions that are not surjective.
Start by excluding from the range."
15478,"Then we have two choices (or )
for where to send each of the five elements of the domain."
15479,"Thus there are 25
functions that exclude from the range."
15480,"Similarly, there are 25 functions that
exclude , and another 25 that exclude ."
15481,"Now have we counted all functions
that are not surjective?"
15482,"Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times.
"
15483,"For example, the function which sends everything to was one of the 25
functions we counted when we excluded from the range, and also one of
the 25 functions we counted when we excluded from the range."
15484,"We must
subtract out all the functions which specifically exclude two elements from
the range."
15485,"There is 1 function when we exclude and (everything goes to
), one function when we exclude and , and one function when we exclude
and .
"
15486,"We are using PIE: To count the functions that are not surjective, we added
up the functions that exclude , , and separately; then subtracted the
functions that exclude pairs of elements."
15487,"We would then add back in the
functions that exclude groups of three elements, except that there are no such
functions."
15488,"We find that the number of functions that are not surjective is

choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to "
15492,"Writing 15 instead of

than 3 elements would be too tedious."

sets the formula for PIE is very long."
15496,"However, we have lucked out."

in the example above, the number of functions that exclude a single element from
the range is the same no matter which single element is excluded."
15498,"Similarly, the
number of functions that exclude a pair of elements will be the same for every pair.
"
15499,"With larger codomains, we will see the same behavior with groups of 3, 4, and more
elements excluded."

15531,"These are not just a few more examples of the techniques we have developed in

How many contain no repeated letters?
Solution.
"
15534,"By now it should be no surprise that there are 85 words, and (8, 5)
words without repeated letters."
15535,"The new piece here is that we are actually
counting functions."

injective functions.
"
15541,"If and are any sets with || = 5 and || = 8, then the number of
functions : is 85 and the number of injections is (8, 5)."
15542,"So if you
can represent your counting problem as a function counting problem, most
of the work is done.

15545,"We saw in Section 3.1 that the answer to both these questions
is 29, as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9 elements in the set
(positions in the bit-string)."
15546,"But 29 also looks like the answer you get from
counting functions."
15547,"In fact, if you count all functions : with || = 9
and || = 2, this is exactly what you get.
"
15548,This makes sense!
15549,"Let = {1, 2, . . ."
15550,", 9} and = {, }."
15551,"We are assigning
each element of the set either a yes or a no."
15552,"Or in the language of bit-strings,
we would take the 9 positions in the bit string as our domain and the set {0, 1}
as the codomain.
"
15553,"So far we have not used a function as a model for binomial coefficients (combi-
nations)."
15554,"Think for a moment about the relationship between combinations and
permutations, say specifically  9

15555,"We do have a function model for (9, 3).

size 9 (say {1, 2, . . ."

example, the function might look like this:

15767,"There is a monastery in Hanoi, as the legend goes, with a great hall containing
three tall pillars."
15768,"Resting on the first pillar were 64 giant disks (or washers),
all different sizes, stacked from largest to smallest.
"
15769,"The monks of the
monastery have been moving the disks for generations, attempting to move
the entire stack of disks to the third pillar."
15770,"However, due to the size of the
disks, the monks cannot move more than one at a time."
15771,"Each disk must be
placed on one of the pillars before the next disk is moved."
15772,"And because the
disks are so heavy and fragile, the monks may never place a larger disk on
top of a smaller disk."
15773,"When the monks finally complete their task, the world
shall come to an end.

15774,"Your task: Figure out how long it will be before we need to start worrying
about the end of the world.

"
15780,"The answer to the puzzle depends on the number of disks you need to move.
"
15781,"In fact, we could answer the puzzle first for 1 disk, then 2, then 3, and so on."
15782,"If we
list all of the answers for each number of disks, we will get a sequence of numbers.

into the problem."
15788,"It is easy to count the number of moves required for a small

15789,"We can then look for a pattern among the first few terms of the

Sequences and Formulas
"
15804,A sequence is simply an ordered list of numbers.
15805,"Unlike a set of numbers, the order
of the numbers in a sequence is an essential characteristic of the sequence."
15806,"For this
reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like
this:
0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
"
15807,"To refer to the entire sequence at once, we will write ()or ()0, or sometimes
if we are being sloppy, just () (in which case we assume we start the sequence with
0).
"
15808,"We might replace the with another letter, and sometimes we omit 0, starting
with 1, in which case we would use ()1 to refer to the sequence as a whole."
15809,"The
numbers in the subscripts are called indices (the plural of index).
"
15810,"While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers, it is really
a type of function."
15811,"Specifically, the sequence ()0 is a function with domain 
where is the image of the natural number ."
15812,"Later we will manipulate sequences
in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus."
15813,"We
can shift a sequence up or down, add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of
a sequence."
15814,"These are done exactly as you would for functions.
"
15815,"That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful,
we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.
"
15816,"Example 4.1.2
Can you find the next term in the following sequences?

"
15821,"5. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .
"
15822,"6. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .
"
15823,"7. 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .
"
15824,"8. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . .
"
15825,"9. 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, . . .
"
15826,"10. 1, 1, 2, 6, . . .
"
15827,"No, you cannot.
"
15828,"You might guess that the next terms are:
"
15829,"1. 7
2."
15830,"3
3. 4
4. 64
5. 49
6."
15831,"34
7. 28
8. 17
9. 2
10."
15832,"In fact, those are the next terms of the sequences I had in mind when I
made up the example, but there is no way to be sure they are correct.
"
15833,"Still, we will often do this."
15834,"Given the first few terms of a sequence, we can
ask what the pattern in the sequence suggests the next terms are.
"
15835,"Given that no number of initial terms in a sequence is enough to say for certain
which sequence we are dealing with, we need to find another way to specify a
sequence."
15836,"We consider two main ways to do this:
Definition 4.1.3 Closed formula.
"
15837,"A closed formula for a sequence ()is a formula for using a fixed
finite number of operations on . This is what you normally think of as a
formula in , just as if you were defining a function in terms "
15838,"Definition 4.1.4 Recursive definition.
"
15839,"A recursive definition (sometimes called an inductive definition) for a
sequence ()consists of a recurrence relation : an equation relating a
term of the sequence to previous terms (terms with smaller"
15840,"It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:

4.1."
15841,"Describing Sequences
315
Example 4.1.5
Here are a few closed formulas for sequences:
 = 2.
"
15842," = (+ 1)
2
.
"
15843," =

1+

5
2




.
"
15844,"Note in each formula, if you are given , you can calculate directly:
Just plug in . For example, to find 3 in the second sequence, just compute
3 = 3(3+1)
2
= 6.
"
15845,"Here are a few recursive definitions for sequences:
 = 21 with 0 = 1.
 = 21 with 0 = 27.
 = 1 + 2 with 0 = 0 and 1 = 1.
"
15846,"In these formulas, if you are given , you cannot calculate directly; you
first need to find 1 (or 1 and 2)."
15847,"In the second sequence, to find 3
you would take 22, but to find 2 ="
15848,21 we would need to know 1 = 20.
15849,"We
do know this, so we could trace back through these equations to find 1 = 54,
2 = 108 and finally 3 = 216.
"
15850,"You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences.
"
15851,"After all, it is harder to find with a recursive definition than with a closed formula.
"
15852,"This is true, but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to
find a recursive definition."
15853,"So to find a useful closed formula, we might first find the
recursive definition, and then use that to find the closed formula.
"
15854,"Example 4.1.6
For defeating the evil dragon, the king promises you a reward of one grain
of rice on the first day, and then twice as many grains the next day as the
previous day, for the rest of the m"
15855,"Not to be swindled, you barter and get him to agree to add one additional
grain of rice each day as well.
"
15856,"How many grains of rice will you receive on the 30th day?
Solution.
"
15857,"We can write down the first few terms of the sequence ()1

4."
15858,"Sequences
that gives the number of grains of rice you receive on day . We get
1, 3, 7, 15, . . ."
15859,",
since, for example, on day 4, you take the number of grains of rice you had on
day 3 (all seven of them), double that and add 1, to get 15."
15860,"The next day you
would get 2  15 + 1 = 31.
"
15861,"By actually computing these values, we see right away what the recurrence
relation is:
= 21 + 1.
"
15862,"This is justified because the problem the sequence is modeling says that we
double the number of grains each day, and then add 1."
15863,"We can read the
recurrence relation right off the problem.
"
15864,The original question asked about 30.
15865,"We could find this using the
recurrence relation, but we would first need to find 29, and to find that we
would need 28, which requires 27 first, and so on."
15866,"While Im sure we could
work all the way back to 4, which we already found, this sounds like a lot of
work.
"
15867,It would be so much nicer to have a closed formula.
15868,"If we could solve the
recurrence relation and find that closed formula, we could just substitute 30 for
.
Lets guess."
15869,"It looks like the sequence is close to 2, 4, 8, 16, . . ."
15870,"which has
closed formula 2."
15871,"That sequence has terms one greater than the terms in our
sequence, so we might guess that
= 21.
"
15872,"To be clear, we have no good reason to believe this guess is correct, but maybe
later in this chapter we will."
15873,"However, if it is correct, then we are golden (and
incredibly sick of rice):
30 = 230 1 = 1, 073, 741, 823.
"
15874,This is not to say that recursive definitions arent useful in finding .
15875,"You can
always calculate given a recursive definition; it might just take a while.
"
15876,"Example 4.1.7
Find 6 in the sequence defined by = 21 2 with 0 = 3 and 1 = 4.
Solution.
"
15877,We know that 6 = 25 4.
15878,"So to find 6 we need to find 5 and
4."
15879,"Well
5 = 24 3
and
4 = 23 2,

4.1."
15880,"Describing Sequences
317
so if we can only find 3 and 2, we would be set."
15881,"Of course
3 = 22 1
and
2 ="
15882,so we only need to find 1 and 0.
15883,But we are given these.
15884,"Thus
0 = 3
1 = 4
2 = 2  4 3 = 5
3 = 2  5 4 = 6
4 = 2  6 5 = 7
5 = 2  7 6 = 8
6 = 2  8 7 = 9.
"
15885,"Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the th term of the
sequence: = + 3."
15886,"To be sure this will always work, we could plug in this
formula into the recurrence relation:
21 2 = 2((1)"
15887,+ 3) ((2)
15888,"+ 3)
= 2+ 4 1
= + 3
= .
That is not quite enough though, since there can be multiple closed
formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation; we must also check that our
closed formula agrees on the"
15889,"Since 0 = 0+3 = 3
and 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 are the correct initial conditions, we can now conclude that
we have the correct closed formula.
"
15890,"Finding closed formulas, or even recursive definitions, for sequences is not trivial.
"
15891,There is no one method for doing this.
15892,"Just as in evaluating integrals or solving
differential equations, it is useful to have a bag of tricks you can apply, but sometimes
there is no easy answer.
"
15893,"One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence for which
we already know the closed formula."

we shift: (+ 2)(+ 3).

Partial Sums and Differences
Some sequences naturally arise as the sum of terms of another sequence.

"
15968,"Sequences
Example 4.1.9
Sam keeps track of how many push-ups she does each day of her do lots of
push-ups challenge."
15969,"Let ()1 be the sequence that describes the number
of push-ups done on the th day of the challenge."
15970,"The sequence starts
3, 5, 6, 10, 9, 0, 12, . . . .
"
15971,"Describe a sequence ()1 that gives the total number of push-ups done by
Sam after the th day.
"
15972,"We can find the terms of this sequence easily enough.
"
15973,"3, 8, 14, 24, 33, 33, 45, . . ."
15974,"Here 1 is just 1, but then
2 = 3 + 5 = 1 + 2,
3 = 3 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3,
and so on.
"
15975,There are a few ways we might describe in general.
15976,"We could do so
recursively as,
= 1 + ,
since the total number of push-ups done after days will be the number done
after 1 days, plus the number done on day .
For something closer to a closed formula, "
15977,"Given any sequence (), we can always form a new sequence ()by
= 0 + 1 + 2 +   "
15978,"+ .
Since the terms of () are the sums of the initial part of the sequence (), we call
() the sequence of partial sums of ().

possible to find a closed formula for () from the closed formula for ().

15985,It is also often useful to look at the sequence of difference of a sequence ().
15986,"By
this we just mean the sequence () where
= +1 .
"
15987,"For example, if () = (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .)"
15988,"(the square numbers, so = 2), then the
sequence of differences is () = (3, 5, 7, 9, . . .)"
15989,"since 4 1 = 3, 9 4 = 5, and so on.
"
15990,"We could also find a closed formula for the sequence of differences here since we
have a closed formula for . We would have
= +1 = (+ 1)2 2 = 2 + 2+ 1 2 = 2+ 1.
"
15991,"In general, it is easy to go from a closed formula for a sequence to a closed
formula for the sequence of differences."
15992,"It is not always easy to go the other way
around."
15993,"In fact, what would it look like to start with a sequence of differences and
get the original sequence?
Thinking about a recurrence relation is helpful here."
15994,"Since
= +1 ,
we have that
+1 = + .
"
15995,"This makes sense: to get from one term of a sequence to the next, you add the
difference between those terms."
15996,You add the differences.
15997,"So the original
sequence is the sequence of partial sums of the sequence of differences!
"
15998,"In upcoming sections we will see that understanding the sequence of differences
can tell us exactly where to look for a closed formula."
15999,"The differences also suggest
how to create a recursive definition.

Example 4.1.11
Find a recurrence relation and initial conditions that agree with the terms of
this sequence: 1, 5, 17, 53, 161, 485 . ."
16001,"Finding the recurrence relation would be easier if we had some
context for the problem (like the Tower of Hanoi, for example)."
16002,"Alas, we
have only the sequence."
16003,"Remember, the recurrence relation tells you how to
get from previous terms to future terms."
16004,What is going on here?
16005,"We could
look at the differences between terms: 4, 12, 36, 108, . ."
16006,"Notice that these are
growing by a factor of 3."
16007,Is the original sequence as well?
16008,"1  3 = 3, 5  3 = 15,
17  3 = 51 and so on."
16009,"It appears that we always end up with 2 less than the
next term."
16010,"So = 31 + 2 is our recurrence relation and the initial condition is
0 = 1.
"
16011,"4.1.4
Sequences in python
Checking that a closed formula agrees with the initial terms in a sequence is easy
with a calculator, or better yet, a programming language like python."
16012,"One way you
can do this is to define a function that returns the th term of the sequence.
"
16013,"Here is an example: Suppose you wanted to check whether a formula you found
for the sequence ()= (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .)"
16014,"Perhaps you guess that
= 21."
16015,Try running the code below.
16016,"(Note: In python, the ^ symbol means
something else, so to do exponentiation, we use **.)
"
16017,"def a(n):
return 2**n-1
print(a(3))
"
16018,"Looks promising, but we should be careful: Our sequence started with 0 = 1,
which makes 3 = 15."
16019,"Now try modifying the definition of a(n) (by changing the
return value) to get the correct closed formula.
"
16020,Perhaps you want to print out the first 20 terms of the sequence?
16021,"This is easy to
do with python, by putting the terms in a list:
def a(n):
return 2**(n+1) - 1
sequence ="
16022,"[]
for n in range (20):
sequence.append(a(n))
print(sequence)
Note that range(20) starts at 0 and stops at 19 (it is the list [0,1,2,...,19]).
"
16023,"We can also use python to generate terms for a sequence given a recursive
definition."
16024,Suppose we wanted to explore the sequence = 21
16025,"+ 1 with initial
condition 0 = 1."
16026,"In python, we could generate the sequence as follows.

4.1."
16027,"Describing Sequences

if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return 2*a(n-1)+1

for i in range (10):
print(a(i))

We can easily compute the first few terms of the sequence: 2, 6, 10, 14, . ."
16161,"How
do I know this is correct?"
16162,"From the problem, we see that to get from one term to the
next, we must add 4."
16163,"It is clear then that the recurrence relation for the sequence is
= 1 + 4.
"
16164,"The rate of growth for the sequence is the constant 4 since the difference between any
two terms is 4 (note, we could write the recurrence relation as 1 = 4).
"
16165,"We call sequences with a constant rate of change arithmetic sequences.
"
16166,Now lets find a closed formula for our sequence.
16167,The first term is 0 = 2.
16168,"To get
1, we add 4."
16169,"The next term requires us to add 4 again, which means we have added
4 to our initial term twice."
16170,"Then we add 4 again, for a total of three times for 3."
16171,"In
fact, to get , we will have added 4 to 0 a total of times."
16172,"Thus, the closed formula
for the sequence is
= 2 + 4.
"
16173,This works for any arithmetic sequence.
16174,"That is, any sequence with a constant
difference will have a linear closed formula, where the slope of the linear function
is the common difference.
"
16175,"If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence is
arithmetic."
16176,"If the initial term (0) of the sequence is and the common
difference is , then we have,
Recursive definition: = 1 + with 0 = .
Closed formula: = + .
"
16177,"As we did for our example above, for the recursive definition, we need to specify
0."
16178,Then we need to express in terms of 1.
16179,"If we call the first term , then
0 = ."
16180,"For the recurrence relation, by the definition of an arithmetic sequence, the
difference between successive terms is some constant, say . So 1 = , or in
other words,
0 = 
= 1 + .
Lets now argue why th"
16181,"One way we could do this
is by using a technique sometimes called telescoping (a name which hopefully we
become meaningful momentarily).
"
16182,"We write the recurrence relation in its difference form, 1 = for all terms
starting with 1 and going up to ."
16183,"This gives the following:

Now we add all equations together.
"
16187,"On the right-hand side, we have added to itself times, so the sum is  .
On the left-hand side, we get the sum:
(1 0)"
16188,+ (2 1)
16189,+ (3 2)
16190,"+    + (1 2) + (1).
"
16191,"But look what happens when we regroup and cancel like terms:

2 
1 +
3 
2 +    +
1 
2 + 
1 = 0.
"
16192,"The sum telescopes down to be nice and compact for easy storage.
"
16193,"Putting the two sides together gives us
0 =  
which becomes
= 0 +  
as we claimed.
"
16194,"The telescoping we did above is useful in other contexts (see Exercise 4.2.7.6),
but now that we have established a general form of the closed formula, we can apply
it to any arithmetic sequence.
"
16195,"Example 4.2.1
Find recursive definitions and closed formulas for the arithmetic sequences
below."
16196,"Assume the first term listed is 0.
"
16197,"1. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, . ."
16198,"2. 50, 43, 36, 29, . ."
16199,"First we should check that these sequences really are arithmetic
by taking differences of successive terms."
16200,"Doing so will reveal the common
difference .
1. 5 2 = 3, 8 5 = 3, etc."
16201,"To get from each term to the next, we add three,
so = 3."
16202,"The recursive definition is therefore = 1 + 3 with 0 = 2.
"
16203,"The closed formula is = 2 + 3.
2."
16204,"Here the common difference is 7, since we add 7 to 50 to get 43, and
so on."

"
16206,"The closed formula is = 50 7.
4.2.3
Geometric Sequences
What about sequences like 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .?"
16207,"This is not arithmetic because the
difference between terms is not constant."
16208,"However, the ratio between successive
terms is constant: 6
3 = 12
6 = 24
12 =   "
16209,"= 2 We call such sequences geometric.

Recognizing that the sequence is geometric lets us easily write down a recursive
definition."
16211,"= 22, with 0 = 3.
"
16212,A closed formula is also not difficult to reason out.
16213,"How do we get the term 3
for example?"
16214,"We start with 3, then multiply by 2 to get 1, multiply by 2 again to get
2, and multiply by 2 a third time to get 3."
16215,"So we multiplied 3 by 2 a total of three
times, or 3 = 3  23."
16216,"It looks like = 3  2.
In general, the recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term 
and common ratio will be
= 1  ; 0 = .
To get the next term we multiply the previous term by .
"
16217,"For the general closed formula, we could try something like telescoping again,
although we would need to cancel fractions."

for solving recurrence relations called iteration."

Geometric Sequences.
"
16228,"A sequence is called geometric if the ratio between successive terms is
constant."
16229,Suppose the initial term 0 is and the common ratio is .
16230,"Then we
have,
Recursive definition: = 1 with 0 = .
Closed formula: =  .
Example 4.2.2
Find the recursive and closed formula for the geometric sequences below.
"
16231,"Again, the first term listed is 0.
"
16232,"1. 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .
"
16233,"2. 27, 9, 3, 1, 1/3, . . .

dividing each term by its previous term."
16236,"If this ratio really is constant, we
will have found .
1. 6/3 = 2, 12/6 = 2, 24/12 = 2, etc."
16237,"Yes, to get from any term to the next,
we multiply by ="
16238,"So the recursive definition is = 21 with
0 = 3."
16239,"The closed formula is = 3  2.
2."
16240,The common ratio is = 1/3.
16241,"So the sequence has recursive definition
= 1
31 with 0 = 27 and closed formula = 27  1
3
.
Geometric sequences are those which have a growth rate that is proportional
to the sequence itself."
16242,"Just like you might have seen in calculus, it is exactly the
exponential functions that have this property.
"
16243,"In the examples and formulas above, we assumed that the initial term was 0."
16244,"If
your sequence starts with 1, you can easily find the term that would have been 0
and use that in the formula."
16245,"For example, if we want a formula for the sequence
2, 5, 8, . . ."
16246,"and insist that 2 = 1, then we can find 0 = 1 (since the sequence is
arithmetic with common difference 3, we have 0 + 3 = 1)."
16247,"Then the closed formula
will be = 1 + 3.
Remark 4.2.3"
16248,"If you look at other sources, you might find that their closed
formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences differ from ours."
16249,"Specifically,
you might find the formulas = + (1)(arithmetic) and =  1
(geometric)."
16250,Which is correct?
16251,"In our case, we take to be 0."
16252,"If instead
we had 1 as our initial term, we would get the (slightly more complicated)
formulas you find elsewhere.
"
16253,"4.2.4
Beyond Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences
Look at the sequence ()1 which starts 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, . ."
16254,"These are called the
triangular numbers since they represent the number of dots in an equilateral triangle
(think of how you arrange 10 bowling pins: a row of 4 plus a row of 3 plus a row of
2 and a r"
16255,"1 = 1
2 = 3
3 = 6
4 = 10
Is this sequence arithmetic?"
16256,"No, since 3 1 = 2 and 6 3 = 3 2, so there is no
common difference."
16257,Is the sequence geometric?
16258,"No. 3/1 = 3 but 6/3 = 2, so there is
no common ratio."
16259,"What to do?
Notice that the differences between terms do form an arithmetic sequence:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .."
16260,"In other words, the rate of change of this sequence is arithmetic:

4.2."
16261,"Rate of Growth

1 = , which immediately gives us the recurrence relation = 1 + .
Another way to think of this is that the th term of the sequence () is the sum of
the first terms in the sequence 1,"
16262,"Thus () is the sequence of partial
sums of the sequence 1, 2, 3, . . ."
16263,"(partial sums because we are not taking the sum of
all infinitely many terms).
"
16264,"This should become clearer if we expand the recurrence relation to write the
triangular numbers like this:
1 = 1 = 1
2 = 3 = 1 + 2
3 = 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
4 = 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
...
...
"
16265,"= 1 + 2 + 3 +    + .
We are really using iteration here."
16266,"We could also have seen this by using telescoping,
taking 0 = 0:
1 0 =1
2 1 =2
3 2 =3
...
1 =.

16267,"Consider how we could find the sum of the first 100 positive integers

"
16269,The next pair to combine is 2 + 99 = 101.
16270,Then 3 + 98 = 101.
16271,"This gives

16434,"Not a huge surprise: One way to count the number of squares in a 44 chessboard
is to notice that there are 16 squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with

squares."
16436,"Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since its sequence of

which is an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2)."
16439,"Notice that our original
sequence had third differences (that is, differences of differences of differences of
the original) constant."
16440,We will call such a sequence 3-constant.
16441,"The sequence
1, 4, 9, 16, . . ."
16442,"has second differences constant, so it will be a 2-constant sequence.
"
16443,"In general, we will say a sequence is a -constant sequence if the th differences
are constant.
"
16444,"Example 4.3.4
Which of the following sequences are -constant for some value of ?
1. 2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, . ."
16445,"2. 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, . ."
16446,"3. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, . ."
16447,"This is the sequence from Example 4.3.3, in which we found a closed
formula by recognizing the sequence as the sequence of partial sums
of an arithmetic sequence."
16448,"Indeed, the sequence of first differences
is 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, . ."
16449,"., which itself has differences 3, 3, 3, 3, . ."
16450,"Thus
2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, . ."
16451,"is a 2-constant sequence.
"
16452,"These are the perfect cubes.
"
16453,"The sequence of first differences is
7, 19, 37, 61, 91, . ."
16454,".; the sequence of second differences is 12, 18, 24, 30, . ."
16455,".;
the sequence of third differences is constant: 6, 6, 6, . ."
16456,"Thus the perfect
cubes are a 3-constant sequence.
"
16457,"If we take first differences, we get 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . ."
16458,"Thats
the sequence we started with."
16459,"So taking second differences will give us
the same sequence again."
16460,"No matter how many times we repeat this
we will always have the same sequence, which in particular means no
finite number of differences will be constant."
16461,"Thus this sequence is not
-constant for any .
The 0-constant sequences are themselves constant, so a closed formula for
them is easy to compute (its just the constant)."
16462,"The 1-constant sequences are
arithmetic, and we have a method for finding closed formulas for them as well.
"
16463,"Every 2-constant sequence is the sum of an arithmetic sequence, so we can find
formulas for these as well."
16464,"But notice that the format of the closed formula for a
2-constant sequence is always quadratic."
16465,"For example, the square numbers are
2-constant with closed formula = 2."
16466,"The triangular numbers (also 2-constant)
have closed formula = (+1)
2
, which when multiplied out gives you an 2 term as
well."
16467,"It appears that every time we increase the complexity of the sequence, that
is, increase the number of differences before we get constants, we also increase the

16469,"We go from constant to linear
to quadratic."
16470,"The sequence of differences between terms tells us something about
the rate of growth of the sequence."
16471,"If a sequence is growing at a constant rate, then
the formula for the sequence will be linear."
16472,"If the sequence is growing at a rate which
itself is growing at a constant rate, then the formula is quadratic."
16473,"You might have
seen this elsewhere: If a function has a constant second derivative (rate of change),
then the function must be quadratic.
"
16474,"This works in general:
Theorem 4.3.5 Polynomial Fitting.
"
16475,"The closed formula for a sequence will be a degree polynomial if and only if the
sequence is -constant (i.e., the th sequence of differences is constant).
"
16476,"This tells us that the sequence of numbers of squares on a chessboard, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, . ."
16477,".,
which we saw to be 3-constant, will have a cubic (degree 3 polynomial) for its
closed formula.
"
16478,"Now once we know what format the closed formula for a sequence will take, it is
much easier to actually find the closed formula."
16479,"In the case that the closed formula
is a degree polynomial, we just need + 1 data points to fit the polynomial to
the data.
"
16480,"Example 4.3.6
Find a formula for the sequence 3, 7, 14, 24, . . .."
16481,"Assume 1 = 3.
Solution.
"
16482,"First, check to see if the formula has constant differences at some
level."
16483,"The sequence of first differences is 4, 7, 10, . . ."
16484,"which is arithmetic, so
the sequence of second differences is constant."
16485,"The sequence is 2-constant,
so the formula for will be a degree 2 polynomial."
16486,"That is, we know that for
some constants , , and ,
= 2"
16487,"+ + .
"
16488,"Now to find , , and . First, it would be nice to know what 0 is, since
plugging in = 0 simplifies the above formula greatly."
16489,"In this case, 0 = 2
(work backward from the sequence of constant differences)."
16490,"Thus
0 = 2 =  02 +  0"
16491,"+ ,
so = 2."
16492,Now plug in = 1 and = 2.
16493,"We get
1 = 3 = + + 2

"
16525,"As we saw in Example 4.3.4, this sequence is not -constant for any .
"
16526,Therefore the closed formula for the sequence is not a polynomial.
16527,"In
fact, we know the closed formula is = 2, which grows faster than
any polynomial (so is not a polynomial).
"
16528,"The sequence of first differences is 7, 43, 133, 301, 571, . ."
16529,"The second
differences are: 36, 90, 168, 270, . . .."
16530,"Third differences: 54, 78, 102, . ."
16531,"Fourth differences: 24, 24, . ."
16532,"As far as we can tell, this sequence of

16536,"We
notice that after the first few terms, we get the original sequence back.

Warning 4.3.10"
16539,"A degree polynomial is completely determined by its + 1

find a degree polynomial when given + 1 terms of a sequence.

"
16545,"4.3.4
Solving Systems of Equations with Technology
"
16546,"The point of polynomial fitting is that if we can be sure that a sequence has a
polynomial as its closed formula, then we can find that formula."
16547,"Since we know the
degree of the polynomial, all we need is to find its coefficients, and with enough
terms of the sequence, we can find a system of enough linear equations whose
solution will be those"
16548,"However, this requires solving a system of linear
equations.
"
16549,"For a degree 2 polynomial, we need to find three coefficients (the constant term,
the coefficient of , and the coefficient of 2)."
16550,"A system of three linear equations will
be enough to find these three unknowns."
16551,"In fact, since 0 will be the constant term,
we can really get away with just two equations and two unknowns, and this is not
difficult to solve by hand.
"
16552,"For higher degree polynomials, the number of equations is larger, and solving by
hand can be tedious."
16553,"Luckily, it is easy for computers to solve these equations."
16554,"Below
we demonstrate how to use the free computer algebra system SageMath, as well as
python, to solve these systems of equations."
16555,"Besides these two choices, pretty much
any computer algebra system (including Wolfram Alpha) can solve these systems of
equations.
"
16556,"Suppose we have the following system of three equations and three unknowns,
as in the chess board example above:
1"
16557,"=+ + 
5 =8+ 4+ 2
14 =27+ 9+ 3
"
16558,"In SageMath, we can use the solve method to solve the system of equations."
16559,"Here
is the code:
var('abc')
solve(
[
a+b+c==1,
8*a+4*b+2*c==5,
27*a+9*b+3*c==14
], a,b,c)

348
4."
16560,"[[a == (1/3), b == (1/2), c == (1/6)]]
This is easier than in python, but python might be more readily available."
16561,"One
way you can solve the system in python is to use the numpy library."
16562,"In this case,
you would create a matrix of coefficients and a vector of constants, and then use the
solve method."
16563,"Here is the code:
import numpy as np
A = np.array ([[1 ,1 ,1] ,[8 ,4 ,2] ,[27 ,9 ,3]]"
16564,")
b = np.array ([1 ,5 ,14])
"
16565,"x = np.linalg.solve(A,b)

16671,You have a large collection of 1  1 squares and 1  2 dominoes.
16672,"You want to
arrange these to make a 1  15 strip."
16673,"How many ways can you do this?
"
16674,"What if the squares come in three different colors and the dominos come
in four different colors?"
16675,"And why is this second question easier than the
first?
Hint.
"
16676,Start by creating a recurrence relation.
16677,"How are the different 1  3
strips and 1  4 strips related to the 1  5 strips?
"
16678,"In Section 4.3 we saw that if a sequence has some sequence of differences that is
constant, then the sequence has a polynomial closed formula."
16679,"Are there sequences
that never have constant differences?"
16680,"And what would their closed formulas look
like?
Consider the Fibonacci sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, . . . .
"
16681,"If we look at the first differences, we get this sequence:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . ."
16682,",
which is the Fibonacci sequence itself."
16683,"This is not surprising, since the Fibonacci
sequence is defined by the recurrence relation = 1 + 2."
16684,"That is saying
precisely that to get the next turn of the sequence, we take the current term and
add... a term in the sequence!
"
16685,"Of course, if we take another difference, we will get the same sequence back, and
again and again, so no th differences will be constant.
"
16686,"Another sequence that has this behavior is the powers of 2:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, . . .

16689,"We can also see this from the recurrence relation, since
= 21 = 1 + 1.
"
16690,"The rate of growth for this, and in fact any geometric sequence, is the sequence itself.
"
16691,"If you have studied calculus, you may recall that the functions that have them-
selves (or close) as their rate of change (derivative, in the calculus context) are exactly
the exponential functions."
16692,"Here too, geometric sequences, which have exponential
closed formulas, have themselves as their rate of change.
"
16693,"In this section, we will explore sequences that are changing at a rate proportional
to the sequence itself, and see how these all have an exponential closed formula, or
some variation of that.

Summing Geometric Sequences: Multiply, Shift, and Subtract
Suppose a candy machine dispenses candy in a geometric sequence by first giving 1
candy, then 2 candies, then 4, then 8, and so on."

We can create the sequence of partials sum as 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, . . .
"
16708,"that gives
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, . ."
16709,"This is not a geometric sequence, but is almost."
16710,"In fact, if we add 1 to each term, we
get what sure looks like the geometric sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, . ."
16711,"so we might
guess that the closed formula for the sequence of sums is 2+1 1."
16712,"If this is correct,
then the answer to the candy question would be 211 1 = 2047.
"
16713,"More intriguing though is the observation that the sequence of partial sums of a
geometric sequence is again geometric-ish."
16714,"Lets consider how to find the sum of a
geometric sequence in general.
"
16715,"We cannot just reverse and add as we did for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.
"
16716,Do you see why?
16717,"The reason we got the same term added to itself many times
is because there was a constant difference."
16718,"So as we added that difference in one
direction, we subtracted the difference going the other way, leaving a constant total.
"
16719,"For geometric sums; we have a different technique.
"
16720,"Example 4.4.1
What is 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 +    + 12288?
Solution.
"
16721,"Multiply each term by 2, the common ratio."
16722,"We get 2= 6 + 12 +
24 +    + 24576."
16723,Now subtract: 2= 3 + 24576 = 24573.
16724,"Since 2= ,
we have our answer.
"
16725,"To better see what happened in the above example, we can write it this way:
=
3 +
6 + 12 + 24 +    + 12288

2=
6 + 12 + 24 +    + 12288
+24576
=
3 +
0"
16726,"+ 0 +    + 0
24576
Then divide both sides by 1 and we have the same result for . The idea is, by
multiplying the sum by the common ratio, each term becomes the next term."
16727,"We
shift over the sum to get the subtraction to mostly cancel out, leaving just the first
term and the new last term.
"
16728,"Example 4.4.2
Find a closed formula for () = 2 + 10 + 50 +    + 2  5.

16729,The common ratio is 5.

16743,"as a sum of the geometric sequence 0.46, 0.0046, 0.000046, . . ."
16744,"The common

16745,"The only real difference is that we are now computing an infinite
geometric sum, we do not have the extra last term to consider."
16746,"Really, this is
the result of taking a limit as we would in calculus when we compute infinite
geometric sums.
"
16747,"To summarize, we now can find a closed formula for a sequence that has a rate
of growth that is an exponential function: 1 = , where is a geometric
sequence (i.e., an exponential function)."

The Characteristic Root Technique
Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation expressed as a combination of the
two previous terms, such as = 1 + 62."
16751,"In other words, we want to find a
function of which satisfies 1 62 = 0."
16752,"Think about how we build up
this sequence iteratively.
"
16753,"2 = 1 + 60
3 = 2 + 61"
16754,"1 + 60 + 61
4 = 3 + 62 = 1 + 60 + 61"
16755,"+ 620 + 621
Lets stop there and agree this is getting very complicated."
16756,"However, we do notice
that in each step, we would, among other things, multiply a previous iteration by 6.
"
16757,So our closed formula would include 6 multiplied some number of times.
16758,"Thus it is
reasonable to guess the solution will contain parts that look geometric."
16759,"Perhaps the
solution will take the form for some constant .
"
16760,"The nice thing is, we know how to check whether a formula is actually a solution
to a recurrence relation: plug it in."
16761,"What happens if we plug in into the recursion
above?"
16762,"We get
1 62 = 0.
"
16763,"Now solve for :

so by factoring, = 2 or = 3 (or = 0, although this does not help us)."
16766,"This tells
us that = (2)is a solution to the recurrence relation, as is = 3. Which one is
correct?"
16767,"They both are, unless we specify initial conditions."
16768,"Notice we could also
have = (2)+3. Or = 7(2)+43. In fact, for any and , = (2)+3
is a solution (try plugging this into the recurrence relation)."
16769,"To find the values of 
and , use the initial conditions.
"
16770,"This points us in the direction of a more general technique for solving recurrence
relations."
16771,Notice we will always be able to factor out the 2 as we did above.
16772,"So
we really only care about the other part."
16773,"We call this other part the characteristic
equation for the recurrence relation."
16774,"We are interested in finding the roots of the
characteristic equation, which are called (surprise) the characteristic roots.
"
16775,"Given a recurrence relation + 1 + 2 = 0, the characteristic
polynomial is
2 + + 
giving the characteristic equation:
2 + + = 0.
"
16776,"If 1 and 2 are two distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial (i.e.,
solutions to the characteristic equation), then the solution to the recurrence
relation is
= 
1 + 
2 ,
where and are constants"
16777,"Example 4.4.4
Solve the recurrence relation = 71 102 with 0 = 2 and 1 = 3.
Solution.
"
16778,Rewrite the recurrence relation 71 + 102 = 0.
16779,"Now
form the characteristic equation:
2 7+ 10 = 0
and solve for :
(2)(5) = 0,
so = 2 and = 5 are the characteristic roots."
16780,"We therefore know that the
solution to the recurrence relation will have the form
= 2+ 5.
To find and , plug in = 0"
16781,"and = 1 to get a system of two equations
with two unknowns:

Perhaps the most famous recurrence relation is = 1 + 2, which togethe"
16784,"But
notice that this is precisely the type of recurrence relation on which we can use the
characteristic root technique."
16785,"When we do, the only thing that changes is that the
characteristic equation does not factor, so we must use the quadratic formula to
find the characteristic roots."
16786,"In fact, doing so gives the third most famous irrational
number, , the golden ratio.
"
16787,"Before leaving the characteristic root technique, we should think about what
might happen when solving the characteristic equation."
16788,"We have an example above
in which the characteristic polynomial has two distinct roots."
16789,"These roots can be
integers, or perhaps irrational numbers (requiring the quadratic formula to find
them)."
16790,"In these cases, we know what the solution to the recurrence relation looks
like.
"
16791,"However, it is possible for the characteristic polynomial to have only one root.
"
16792,This can happen if the characteristic polynomial factors as ()2.
16793,"It is still the case
that would be a solution to the recurrence relation, but we wont be able to find
solutions for all initial conditions using the general form = 
1 + 
2 , since we
cant distinguish "
16794,"We are in luck though:
Characteristic Root Technique for Repeated Roots.
"
16795,"Suppose the recurrence relation = 1 + 2 has a characteristic
polynomial with only one root ."
16796,"Then the solution to the recurrence relation
is
= + 
where and are constants determined by the initial conditions.
"
16797,"Notice the extra in . This allows us to solve for the constants and from
the initial conditions.
"
16798,"Example 4.4.5
Solve the recurrence relation = 61 92 with initial conditions 0 = 1
and 1 = 4.
Solution.
"
16799,The characteristic polynomial is 2 6+ 9.
16800,"We solve the charac-
teristic equation

16801,"Exponential Sequences

by factoring:
(3)2 = 0,
so = 3 is the only characteristic root."
16802,"Therefore we know that the solution
to the recurrence relation has the form
= 3+ 3
for some constants and ."
16803,"Now use the initial conditions:
0 = 1 = 30 +  0  30 = 
1 = 4 =  3 +  1  3 = 3+ 3.
Since = 1, we find that = 1

16804,"Therefore the solution to the recurrence
relation is

characteristic root technique can be applied to much more compl"
16805,"For example, = 21 + 2 33 has characteristic polynomial
3 22 +3."

we can easily find the characteristic roots and as such solve the recurrence relation
(the solution would look like = 
1 +

3 i"
16807,"It is
also possible that the characteristic roots are complex numbers.
"
16808,"However, the characteristic root technique is only useful for solving recurrence
relations in a particular form: is given as a linear combination of some number
of previous terms."
16809,"These recurrence relations are called linear homogeneous
recurrence relations with constant coefficients."
16810,"The homogeneous refers to the
fact that there is no additional term in the recurrence relation other than a multiple
of terms."
16811,"For example, = 21 + 1 is non-homogeneous because of the additional
constant 1."
16812,"There are general methods of solving such things, but we will not
consider them here, other than through the use of telescoping or iteration described
above.

Recursive Reasoning
We have seen that describing a sequence recursively can often be easier than
describing the sequence with a closed formula."

recursive reasoning can help us prove statements using a proof technique called
mathematical induction."
16877,"This style of proof is especially useful when the different
instances of the statement (for different values of , say) are related recursively.
"

for which we have a recursive definition."

recursively by = 31 2 with 0 = 5."

16882,Will the next number be odd?
16883,"Of course, we
could just compute it using the recurrence relation."
16884,We would take 3  109 2.
16885,"We
dont actually care which odd number this is, just that it is, in fact, odd."
16886,"We know it
will be odd because the product of two odd numbers is odd, and subtracting 2 from
an odd number results in an odd number.
"
16887,"Great, so 4 is odd."
16888,Will 5 be odd too?
16889,"Yes, use the same argument as above:
5 = 34 2."
16890,"We just convinced ourselves that 4 is odd (without finding its actual
value), so 34 is odd, and 2 less than it will be odd too.
"
16891,What about 6?
16892,Do the same thing.
16893,"In fact, why are we using any particular
number as the index?"
16894,"If it is the same argument each time, we should be able to just
give this argument once and say it always works.
"
16895,"Suppose we have found that is odd (where is some arbitrary natural number).
"
16896,"From this, we can find that +1 is odd, since +1 = 32, and 3 times the odd
number will be odd, and subtracting 2 will result in an odd number."
16897,"Lets
put this all together as a proof.
"
16898,"We claim that for any 0, the number is odd, where = 31 2
and 0 = 5.
"
16899,"When = 0, the claim is true, since 0 = 5 is an odd number.
"
16900,"Further, we can prove that every larger has odd because as long as is
odd, so is +1 (since +1 = 32, and 3 times an odd number minus 2 is always
odd).
"
16901,"Therefore is odd for all 0.
"
16902,"Soon we will give a more rigid structure for proofs by induction, but the basic
idea is exactly what we have above.

Formalizing Proofs
Induction can prove many statements that hold for all natural numbers, not just
statements about sequences."

16907,"We are then proving
this sequence of statements:
(0), (1), (2), (3), . . . .
"
16908,"The way we do this with induction is to prove a base case, that (0) is true (or
() where is the least element of our domain of discourse)."
16909,"Next, we prove the
inductive case, that () (+ 1) for all 0 (or ).
"
16910,"Together, these are enough to prove () is true for all . How do we know?
"
16911,"That is, why is this style of proof valid?"
16912,"Well, lets convince ourselves that (3) is
true."
16913,We know (0) is true.
16914,"And because we know that (0) (1), we then also
know that (1) is true."
16915,"Because (1) (2), we then get that (2) is true."
16916,"Finally,
because (2) (3), we have that (3)."
16917,There is nothing special about 3 here.

16919,Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges.
16920,"We want to argue
that in a minute, all the dominoes will have fallen."
16921,"For this to happen, you will
need to push the first domino."
16922,That is the base case.
16923,"It will also have to be that the
dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will
cause the next domino to fall."
16924,That is the inductive case.
16925,"If both of these conditions
are met  you push the first domino over, and each domino will cause the next to
fall  then all the dominoes will fall.
"
16926,Induction is powerful!
16927,"Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes
when you dont have to push over each domino yourself."
16928,"You just start the chain
reaction and then rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the
rest.
"
16929,"When writing a proof by induction, we will follow a standard style."
16930,"Writing in
this style allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us formulate
the proof.
"
16931,"Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:
Induction Proof Structure.
"
16932,"Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: Let () be
the statement. . . ."
16933,"To prove that () is true for all 0, you must prove
two facts:
1."
16934,Base case: Prove that (0) is true.
16935,You do this directly.
16936,"This is often
easy.
"
16937,Inductive case: Prove that () (+ 1) for all 0.
16938,"That is, prove
that for any 0 if () is true, then (+ 1) is true as well."

the proof of an if . ."
16941,then . . .
16942,"statement, so you can assume () is
true (() is called the inductive hypothesis)."
16943,"You must then explain why
(+ 1) is also true, given that assumption.
"
16944,"Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude,
Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement () is
true for all 0.
"
16945,"Sometimes the statement () will only be true for values of 4, for example,
or some other value."
16946,"In such cases, replace all the 0s above with 4s (or the other
value).
"
16947,"Before attempting to prove a statement by mathematical induction, first think
about why the statement is true using inductive reasoning."
16948,"Explain why induction is
the right thing to do, and roughly why the inductive case will work."
16949,"Then, sit down
and write out a careful, formal proof using the structure above.
"
16950,"4.5.4
Examples
Here are some examples of proof by mathematical induction.
"
16951,"Example 4.5.1
Prove for each natural number 1 that 1 + 2 + 3 +    + = (+1)
2
.
Solution.
"
16952,"First, lets think inductively about this equation."
16953,"In fact, we know
this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind)."
16954,"But why might
induction be applicable?"
16955,"The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1
to . If we know how to do that, adding just one more term (+ 1) would
not be that hard."
16956,"For example, if = 100, suppose we know that the sum of
the first 100 numbers is 5050 (so 1 + 2 + 3 +   "
16957,"+ 100 = 5050, which is true).
"
16958,"Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just
add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again."
16959,"We would have
1 + 2 + 3 +   "
16960,+ 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151.
16961,"In fact, it would always be
easy to add just one more term."
16962,"This is why we should use induction.
"
16963,"Now the formal proof:
Proof.
"
16964,"Let () be the statement 1 + 2 + 3 +    + = (+1)
2
."
16965,"We will show
that () is true for all natural numbers 1.
"
16966,"Base case: (1) is the statement 1 = 1(1+1)
2
which is clearly true.
"
16967,Inductive case: Let 1 be a natural number.
16968,"Assume (for induction) that
() is true."
16969,"That means 1 + 2 + 3 +    + = (+1)
2
."
16970,"We will prove that (+ 1)
is true as well."
16971,"That is, we must prove that 1+2+3+  + +(+1) = (+1)(+2)
2
.
"
16972,"To prove this equation, start by adding + 1 to both sides of the inductive

16973,"Proof by Induction
367
hypothesis:
1 + 2 + 3 +    + + (+ 1) = (+ 1)
2
+ (+ 1).
"
16974,"Now, simplifying the right side we get:
(+ 1)
2
+ + 1 = (+ 1)
2
+ 2(+ 1)
2
= (+ 1) + 2(+ 1)
2
= (+ 2)(+ 1)
2
.
"
16975,"Thus (+ 1) is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction, ()
is true for all natural numbers 1.
"
16976,"
Note that in the part of the proof where we proved (+1) from (), we used the
equation ()."
16977,This was the inductive hypothesis.
16978,"Seeing how to use the inductive
hypotheses is usually straightforward when proving a fact about a sum like this."
16979,"In
other proofs, it can be less obvious where it fits in.
"
16980,"Example 4.5.2
Prove that for all , 61 is a multiple of 5.
Solution.
"
16981,"Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem."
16982,"What
does increasing do?"
16983,Lets try with a few examples.
16984,"If = 1, then yes,
61 1 = 5 is a multiple of 5."
16985,What does incrementing to 2 look like?
16986,"We
get 62 1 = 35, which again is a multiple of 5."
16987,"Next, = 3: But instead of
just finding 63 1, what did the increase in do?"
16988,"We will still subtract 1,
but now we are multiplying by another 6 first."
16989,"Viewed another way, we are
multiplying a number that is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because
62 1 is a multiple of 5, so 62 is one more than a multiple of 5)."
16990,"What do
numbers that are one more than a multiple of 5 look like?"
16991,"They must have
last digit 1 or 6."
16992,What happens when you multiply such a number by 6?
16993,"It
depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number
must be a 6."
16994,"And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.
"
16995,"The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a
number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5."
16996,"Now the
formal proof:
Proof.
"
16997,"Let () be the statement, 61 is a multiple of 5."
16998,"We will prove
that () is true for all .
Base case: (0) is true: 60 1 = 0, which is a multiple of 5.
Inductive case: Let be an arbitrary natural number.
"
16999,"Assume, for

368
4."
17000,"Sequences
induction, that () is true."
17001,"That is, 61 is a multiple of 5."
17002,"Then 61 = 5
for some integer ."
17003,This means that 6= 5+ 1.
17004,"Multiply both sides by 6:
6+1 = 6(5+ 1) = 30+ 6.
"
17005,"But we want to know about 6+1 1, so subtract 1 from both sides:
6+1 1 = 30+ 5.
"
17006,"Of course 30+ 5 = 5(6+ 1), so is a multiple of 5.
"
17007,"Therefore 6+1 1 is a multiple of 5, or in other words, (+ 1) is true.
"
17008,"Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction () is true for all . 
We had to be a little bit clever (i.e., use some algebra) to locate the 61 inside
of 6+1 1 before we could apply the inductive hy"
17009,"This is what can make
inductive proofs challenging.
"
17010,"In the two examples above, we started with = 1 or = 0."
17011,"We can start later if
we need to.
"
17012,"Example 4.5.3
Prove that 2 <"
17013,"2for all integers 5.
"
17014,"First, the idea of the argument."
17015,"What happens when we increase
by 1?"
17016,"On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to
the next square number."
17017,"On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2.
"
17018,This means we double the number.
17019,"So the question is, how does doubling
a number relate to increasing to the next square?"
17020,"Think about what the
difference of two consecutive squares looks like."
17021,We have (+ 1)2 2.
17022,"This
factors:
(+ 1)2 2 = (+ 1 )(+ 1 + ) = 2+ 1.
But doubling the right-hand side increases it by 2, since 2+1 = 2+ 2.
"
17023,"When is large enough, 2>"
17024,"What we are saying here is that each time increases, the left-hand side
grows by less than the right-hand side."
17025,"So if the left-hand side starts smaller
(as it does when = 5), it will never catch up."
17026,"Now the formal proof:
Proof.
"
17027,Let () be the statement 2 <
17028,"2. We will prove () is true for all
integers 5.
"
17029,Base case: (5) is the statement 52 < 25.
17030,"Since 52 = 25 and 25 = 32, we see
that (5) is indeed true.
"
17031,Inductive case: Let 5 be an arbitrary integer.
17032,"Assume, for induction,
that () is true."
17033,"That is, assume 2 <"
17034,"We will prove that (+ 1) is true,
i.e., (+ 1)2 < 2+1."
17035,"To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side

4.5."
17036,"Proof by Induction
369
and work towards the right-hand side:
(+ 1)2 = 2 + 2+ 1
< 2+ 2+ 1
. . ."
17037,"by the inductive hypothesis.
< 2+ 2
. . ."
17038,"since 2+ 1 < 2for 5.
"
17039,"Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get (+ 1)2 < 2+1,
in other words, (+1)."
17040,"Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
() is true for all 5.
"
17041,"
The previous example might remind you of the racetrack principle from calculus,
which says that if () < (), and () < () for > , then () < () for
> . Same idea: the larger function is increasing more "
17042,"In discrete math, we dont have derivatives, so
we look at differences."
17043,"Thus induction is the way to go.
"
17044,"With great power, comes great responsibility."
17045,"Induction isnt magic.
"
17046,It seems very powerful to be able to assume () is true.
17047,"After all, we are trying
to prove () is true, and the only difference is in the variable: vs."
17048,". Are we
assuming that what we want to prove is true?"
17049,"We assume () is true
only for the sake of proving that (+ 1) is true.
"
17050,"Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction.
"
17051,"Consider this incorrect proof that every Canadian has the same eye color: Let
() be the statement that any Canadians have the same eye color."
17052,"(1) is true,
since everyone has the same eye color as themselves."
17053,Now assume () is true.
17054,"That
is, assume that in any group of Canadians, everyone has the same eye color."
17055,"Now
consider an arbitrary group of + 1 Canadians."
17056,"The first of these must all have the
same eye color, since () is true."
17057,"Also, the last of these must have the same eye
color, since () is true."
17058,"So in fact, everyone in the group must have the same eye
color."
17059,Thus (+ 1) is true.
17060,"So by the principle of mathematical induction, () is
true for all .
Clearly something went wrong."
17061,"The problem is that the proof that () implies
(+ 1) assumes that 2."
17062,We have only shown (1) is true.
17063,"In fact, (2) is false.

Consider the following puzzle:
You have a rectangular chocolate bar, made up of identical squares of
chocolate."
17252,You can take such a bar and break it along any row or column.
17253,"How
many times will you have to break the bar to reduce it to single chocolate
squares?
"
17254,"At first, this question might seem impossible."
17255,"Perhaps we meant to ask for
the smallest number of breaks needed."
17256,(a) Suppose you started with a 1  3 bar.
17257,"How many breaks would you need
to reduce it to single squares?
"
17258,"(b) If you had a 1  4 bar, how many breaks are required?
"
17259,"If you had 4 squares arranged in a 2  2 square, your first break would
require you to break the chocolate into two 1  2 bars."
17260,"Then each of these
would require
more break(s), for a total of
breaks to go from
the 2  2 to single squares.
"
17261,"(c) A 6-square bar could either be a 1  6 bar, requiring
breaks, or a

17275,"You can build
the ladder as tall as you like because you have instructions for building the next
rung, as long as you are standing on the rung before it.
"
17276,Induction is the corresponding proof technique.
17277,"To prove that you can climb the
ladder as high as you like, you prove that you can step onto the ladder (the base
case) and then prove that, from any rung, you can get to the next rung (the inductive

17278,"More specifically, suppose you were trying to prove that you can get to rung 4 on
the ladder."
17279,"You have successfully proved that you can get to rung 1, and that from
any rung, you can get to the next."
17280,"So you can get to rung 1, and from 1 you can get to
2."
17281,"From 2 you can get to 3, and from 3 you can get to 4."
17282,"Therefore, you can get to 4.
But notice that along the way, you know you have visited rungs 1 through 3."
17283,"We
might as well assume that we have visited all the rungs below the next one we are
trying to reach."
17284,"This is the idea behind strong induction.
"
17285,"A better ladder metaphor for strong induction is to think of ladders as things we
can stack on top of each other."
17286,"We want to argue that it is possible to climb 20 rungs
of a ladder."
17287,"Lets divide that into two smaller ladders, say a 12-rung ladder and an
8-rung ladder."
17288,"We can assume that we can climb both of these since 20 is the least
size we are not yet convinced of."
17289,"Well, put those two ladders together, and you get
12 + 8 = 20 rungs.
"
17290,We better climb down from our shaky metaphor before we hurt ourselves.
17291,"Lets
look at a formal definition of strong induction.

17299,"Sequences
Of course, it is acceptable to replace 0 with a larger base case if needed.2
To illustrate strong induction, lets return to the chocolate bar problem.
"
17300,"Proposition 4.6.2
Given an -square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes 1 breaks to reduce
the bar to single squares.
"
17301,"Let () be the statement, It takes 1 breaks to reduce a -square
chocolate bar to single squares.
"
17302,Base case: Consider (2).
17303,"The squares must be arranged into a 1  2 rectangle,
and we require 2 1 = 1 breaks to reduce this to single squares.
"
17304,"Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary 2 and assume () is true for all .
Consider a (+ 1)-square rectangular chocolate bar."
17305,"Break the bar once along any
row or column."
17306,"This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes and . That is, we
have an -square rectangular chocolate bar, a -square rectangular chocolate bar,
and"
17307,"+ = + 1.
"
17308,"We also know that and , so by our inductive hypothesis, () and
() are true."
17309,"To reduce the -square bar to single squares takes 1 breaks; to
reduce the -square bar to single squares takes 1 breaks."
17310,"Doing this results in
our original bar being reduced to single squares."
17311,"All together it took the initial
break, plus the 1 and 1 breaks, for a total of
1 + 1 + 1"
17312,"= + 1 = + 1 1 = 
breaks."
17313,"Thus (+ 1) is true.
"
17314,"Therefore, by strong induction, () is true for all 2.
"
17315,"Here is a more mathematically relevant example:
Example 4.6.3
Prove that any natural number greater than 1 is either prime or can be written
as the product of primes.
"
17316,"First, the idea: If we take some number , maybe it is prime."
17317,"If so,
we are done."
17318,"If not, then it is composite, so it is the product of two smaller
numbers."
17319,"Each of these factors is smaller than (but at least 2), so we can
repeat the argument with these numbers."
17320,"We have reduced to a smaller case.
"
17321,"Now the formal proof:
Proof.
"
17322,"Let () be the statement, is either prime or can be written as the
product of primes."
17323,"We will prove () is true for all 2.
"
17324,"2Technically, strong induction does not require you to prove a separate base case."
17325,"This is because
when proving the inductive case, you must show that (0) is true, assuming () is true for all < 0.
"
17326,But this is not any help so you end up proving (0) anyway.
17327,"To be on the safe side, we will always
include the base case separately.

4.6."
17328,"Strong Induction
381
Base case: (2) is true because 2 is indeed prime.
"
17329,"Inductive case: assume () is true for all . We want to show that
"
17330,(+ 1) is true.
17331,"That is, we want to show that + 1 is either prime or is the
product of primes."
17332,"If + 1 is prime, we are done."
17333,"If not, then + 1 has more
than 2 divisors, so we can write + 1 = 1  2, with 1 and 2 less than
+ 1 (and greater than 1)."
17334,"By the inductive hypothesis, 1 and 2 are each
either prime or can be written as the product of primes."
17335,"In either case, we
have that 1  2 = + 1 can be written as the product of primes.
"
17336,"Thus by strong induction, () is true for all 2.

Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the statement
you want to prove."
17338,"If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction.
"
17339,"It really is stronger, so can accomplish everything weak induction can."
17340,"That said,
using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the
induction hypothesis."

17402,"In this chapter, we explored sequences and mathematical induction."
17403,"At first,
these might not seem entirely related, but there is a link: recursive reasoning."
17404,"When
we have many cases (maybe infinitely many), it is often easier to describe a particular
case by saying how it relates to other cases, instead of describing it from scratch."
17405,"For
sequences, we can describe the th term in the sequence by saying how it is related
to the previous term."

Discrete Structures Revisited
Throughout the previous chapters, we have seen many examples of discrete structures
and their properties and uses."
17478,"The following sections are self-contained overviews
of each of the main structures we have explored."
17479,"These can either be studied prior
to other material in the book or as a review and reference after the fact.
5.1
Sets
Note that this section contains a lot of detail on what we can say about sets."
17480,"If you
have never seen anything about unions or Venn diagrams, it is worth reading this
carefully.
"
17481,"The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of
math) are sets."
17482,"Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that
you are fluent in the language of set theory."
17483,"Most of the notation we use below is
standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.
"
17484,"For us, a set will simply be an unordered collection of objects."
17485,"Two examples:
We could consider the set of all actors who have played The Doctor on Doctor Who, or
the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive."
17486,"In the first case, Tom Baker is
an element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an
element of the set."
17487,"Also, the two examples are of different sets."
17488,"Two sets are equal
exactly if they contain the exact same elements."
17489,"For example, the set containing all
of the vowels in the Declaration of Independence is precisely the same set as the set
of vowels in the word questionably (namely, all of them); we do not care about"
17490,"5.1.1
Notation
We need some notation to make talking about sets easier."
17491,"Consider,
= {1, 2, 3}.
"
17492,"This is read, is the set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3."
17493,"We use curly
braces {, } to enclose elements of a set."
17494,"Some more notation:
{, , }.
"
17495,The symbol  is read is in or is an element of.
17496,"Thus the above means that
is an element of the set containing the letters , , and"
17497,"Note that this is a true
statement."
17498,"It would also be true to say that is not in that set:
{, , }.
389

390
5."
17499,"Discrete Structures Revisited
Be warned: We write  when we wish to express that one of the elements
of the set is ."
17500,"For example, consider the set,
= {1, , {, , }, }.
"
17501,"This is a strange set, to be sure."
17502,"It contains four elements: the number 1, the
letter b, the set {, , }, and the empty set = {}, the set containing no elements.
"
17503,Is in ?
17504,The answer is no.
17505,"None of the four elements in are the letter , so we
must conclude that . Similarly, consider the set = {1, }."
17506,"Even though the
elements of are elements of , we cannot say that the set is one of the elements
of . Therefore . (Soon we will see that is a subset of , but this is different
from being an element of "
17507,"Sometimes this is
hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely
many)."
17508,"For instance, if we want to be the set of all even natural numbers, would
could write,
= {0, 2, 4, 6, . . ."
17509,"},
but this is a little imprecise."
17510,"A better way would be
= {: there exists such that = 2}.
"
17511,Lets look at this carefully.
17512,"First, there are some new symbols to digest:  is
the symbol usually used to denote the natural numbers, which we will take to be
the set {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}."
17513,"Next, the colon, :, is read such that; it separates the elements
that are in the set from the condition that the elements in the set must satisfy."
17514,"So
putting this all together, we would read the set as, the set of all in the natural
numbers, such that there exists some in the natural numbers for which is twice
."
17515,"In other words, the set of all natural numbers that are even."
17516,"Here is another way
to write the same set.
"
17517,"= {: is even}.
"
17518,"Note: Sometimes mathematicians use | or  for the such that symbol instead of
the colon."
17519,"Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether 0
is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful there.
"
17520,This notation is usually called set builder notation.
17521,"It tells us how to build a set
by telling us precisely the condition elements must meet to gain access (the condition
is the logical statement after the : symbol)."
17522,"Reading and comprehending sets
written in this way takes practice."
17523,"Here are some more examples:
Example 5.1.1
Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out enough
elements to see the pattern.
"
17524,"1. {: + 3 }.
"
17525,"2. {: + 3 }.

"
17526,"Sets
391
3. {: or }.
"
17527,"4. {: and }.
"
17528,"This is the set of all numbers that are 3 less than a natural number (i.e.,
that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number)."
17529,"The set could also
be written as {3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}"
17530,"(note that 0 is a natural number, so
3 is in this set because 3 + 3 = 0).
"
17531,"This is the set of all natural numbers that are 3 less than a natural
number."
17532,"So here we just have {0, 1, 2, 3 . . .}.
"
17533,"This is the set of all integers (positive and negative whole numbers,
written )."
17534,"In other words, {. . . , 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}.
4."
17535,"Here we want all numbers such that and are natural numbers.
"
17536,There is only one: 0.
17537,"So we have the set {0}.
"
17538,There is also a subtle variation on set builder notation.
17539,"While the condition is
generally given after the such that, sometimes it is hidden in the first part."
17540,"Here is
an example.
"
17541,"Example 5.1.2
List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words."
17542,"The set 
is the set of integers; positive and negative whole numbers.
"
17543,"1. = {: 2 }
2."
17544,"= {2 : }
Solution.
"
17545,"The set of integers that pass the condition that their square is a natural
number."
17546,"Well, every integer, when you square it, gives you a non-
negative integer, so a natural number."
17547,"Thus = = {. . . , 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
"
17548,"Here we are looking for the set of all 2s where is a natural number.
"
17549,So this set is simply the set of perfect squares.
17550,"= {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, . . .}.
"
17551,"Another way we could have written this set, using more strict set builder
notation, would be as = {: = 2 for some }.
"
17552,"We already have a lot of notation, and there is more yet."
17553,"Below is a handy chart
of symbols."

Relationships between Sets
We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: They have exactly the
same elements."
17583,"Thus, for example,
{1, 2, 3} = {2, 1, 3}.
"
17584,"(Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.)"

{1, 2, 3} = {1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1"
17586,"+ 1} = {, , } = {1, 2, 3, 1 + 2}
since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers

that every element of is also an element of . Because of this we say that is a

(in fact, {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} is exactly the same set as {1, 2, 3})."

cardinality, such as , the set of rational numbers (written ), the set of even natural
numbers, and the set of real numbers ()."
17626,"It is possible to distinguish between
different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text."

Operations on Sets
Is it possible to add two sets?"
17639,"Not really, however there is something similar."
17640,"If we
want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then
we can take the union of the two sets."
17641,"Symbolically,
= ,
read, is the union of and , means that the elements of are exactly the
elements that are either an element of or an element of (or an element of both).
"
17642,"For example, if = {1, 2, 3} and = {2, 3, 4}, then = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
"
17643,The other common operation on sets is intersection.
17644,"We write,
= 

396
5."
17645,"Discrete Structures Revisited
and say, is the intersection of and , when the elements in are precisely
those both in and in ."
17646,"So if = {1, 2, 3} and = {2, 3, 4}, then = {2, 3}.
"
17647,"Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what
everything is."
17648,Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers.
17649,"In this case
we would say that our universe is . Sometimes we denote this universe by .
Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements that are not in a
particular set."
17650,"We say is the complement of , and write,
= 
when contains every element not contained in . So, if our universe is {1, 2, . . ."
17651,", 9, 10},
and = {2, 3, 5, 7}, then = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}.
"
17652,Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time.
17653,"For example,
consider
.
"
17654,"This is the set of all elements that are both elements of and not elements of
. What have we done?"
17655,"Weve started with and removed all of the elements that
were in . Another way to write this is the set difference:
= \ .
"
17656,"It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, comple-
ment, and difference) on sets produce other sets."
17657,"Dont confuse these with the
symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of)."
17658,"is a set, while
is true or false."
17659,"This is the same difference as between 3 + 2 (which is a
number) and 3 2 (which is false).

"
17675,"= since nothing is added by the empty set.
"
17676,"= since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty set.
"
17677,Having notation like this is useful.
17678,"We will often want to add or remove elements
from sets, and our notation allows us to do so precisely.
"
17679,"Example 5.1.7
If = {1, 2, 3}, then we can describe the set we get by adding the number 4
as {4}."
17680,"If we want to express the set we get by removing the number 2
from , we can do so by writing \ {2}.
"
17681,"If you add an element to the set, you get a new set!"
17682,"So
you would have = {4} and then correctly say that contains 4, but 
does not.
"
17683,"There is one more way to combine sets that will be useful for us: the Cartesian
product,  ."
17684,This sounds fancy but is nothing you havent seen before.
17685,"When
you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane."
17686,"This is the set
of all ordered pairs of real numbers (, )."
17687,"We can do this for any pair of sets, not
just the real numbers with themselves.
"
17688,"Put another way,  = {(, ) : and }."
17689,"The first coordinate comes
from the first set, and the second coordinate comes from the second set."
17690,"Sometimes
we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine:
 = {(, ) : , } (we might also write 2 for this set)."
17691,"Notice that in  ,
we still want all ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate
are the same."
17692,"We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or
quadruples, and so on.

Venn Diagrams
There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets."
17702,"A Venn
diagram displays sets as intersecting circles."
17703,"We can shade the region we are talking
about when we carry out an operation."
17704,"We can also represent the cardinality of a
particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.
"
17705,"




Each circle represents a set."
17706,"The rectangle containing the circles represents the
universe."
17707,"To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding
region."
17708,"For example, we could draw as:

Functions
This section contains many details about functions, much of which should be
familiar from non-discrete contexts."
17791,"As you read, consider how the way we talk
about functions here might be different from what you know from other areas of
mathematics.
"
17792,A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.
17793,"We call the
output the image of the input."
17794,"The set of all inputs for a function is called the
domain."
17795,The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain.
17796,"We would write
: to describe a function with name , domain , and codomain ."
17797,"This
does not tell us which function is though."
17798,"To define the function, we must describe
the rule."
17799,"This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input
(although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).
"
17800,"For example, consider the function : defined by () = 2 + 3."
17801,"Here the
domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers)."
17802,"The rule: Take your
input, multiply it by itself, and add 3."
17803,"This works because we can apply this rule
to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a
natural number (an element of the codomain)."
17804,"Notice though that not every natural
number is actually an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.)."
17805,"The set of natural
numbers that are outputs is called the range of the function (in this case, the range is
{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, . . ."
17806,"}, all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).
"
17807,"The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for
each input."
17808,"That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule."
17809,"What output do we
assign to the input 7?"
17810,"There can only be one answer for any particular function.
"
17811,"Example 5.2.1
The following are all examples of functions:
1. : defined by () ="
17812,"The domain and codomain are both
the set of integers."
17813,"However, the range is only the set of integer multiples
of 3.
2. : {1, 2, 3} {, , } defined by (1)"
17814,"= , (2) = , and (3)"
17815,"The
domain is the set {1, 2, 3}, the codomain is the set {, , } and the range
is the set {, }."
17816,"Note that (2) and (3) are the same element of the
codomain."
17817,"This is okay since each element in the domain still has only
one output.

of natural numbers, . At first you might think this function is th"
17819,"Discrete Structures Revisited
as defined above."
17820,It absolutely is not.
17821,"Even though the rule is the
same, the domain and codomain are different, so these are two different
functions.
"
17822,"Example 5.2.2
Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a
function does not mean that the rule is a function."
17823,"The following are NOT
functions.
"
17824,": defined by () = 
2 ."
17825,"The reason this is not a function is
because not every input has an output."
17826,Where does send 3?
17827,"The rule
says that (3) = 3
2, but 3
2 is not an element of the codomain.
"
17828,"2. Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number.
"
17829,"If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone
numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people
have two phone numbers."
17830,"Switching the domain and codomain sets
doesnt help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple
people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are
reading this).
"
17831,"5.2.1
Describing Functions
It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description."
17832,"The function
is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone
ever talks about it."
17833,"But when we do want to talk about the function, we need a way
to describe it."
17834,"A particular function can be described in multiple ways.
"
17835,"Some calculus textbooks talk about the Rule of Four, that every function can be
described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically,
or in words."
17836,"In discrete math, we can still use any of these to describe functions, but
we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that
have or a finite subset of as their domain."
17837,"Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the
function: plotting the points on the plane."
17838,"We can do this and might get a graph
like the following for a function : {1, 2, 3} {1, 2, 3}.

5.2."
17839,"Functions

It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some
curve."
17840,There are only three elements in the domain.
17841,"A curve would mean that the
domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.
"
17842,"Here is another way to represent that same function:
1
2
2
1
3
3
This shows that the function sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1, and 3 to 3: Just follow the
arrows.
"
17843,"The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in
visualizing functions."
17844,"We will often be working with functions with finite domains,
so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.
"
17845,"Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives the output
for any input is often impossible."
17846,"Of course we could use a piecewise-defined
function, like
() =


+ 1
if = 1
1
if = 2

if = 3
.
"
17847,"This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is a ridiculous
way of doing so.
"
17848,"Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, lets
adopt some notation to describe them."
17849,"All we need is some clear way of denoting
the image of each element in the domain."
17850,"In fact, writing a table of values would
work perfectly:

0
1
2
3
4

3

its output:

algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row

harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.

Generating Functions
"
18180,"There is an extremely powerful tool in discrete mathematics used to manipulate
sequences called the generating function."
18181,"The idea is this: instead of an infinite
sequence (for example: 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, . . .)"
18182,"we look at a single function which encodes
the sequence."
18183,But not a function that gives the th term as output.
18184,"Instead, a function
whose power series (like from calculus) displays the terms of the sequence."
18185,"So for
example, we would look at the power series 2 + 3+ 52 + 83 + 124 +    which
displays the sequence 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, . . ."
18186,"An infinite power series is simply an infinite sum of terms of the form were
is some constant."
18187,"So we might write a power series like this:


=0
.
or expanded like this
0 + 1+ 22"
18188,"+    .
"
18189,"When viewed in the context of generating functions, we call such a power series
a generating series."
18190,"The generating series generates the sequence
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . .
"
18191,"In other words, the sequence generated by a generating series is simply the
sequence of coefficients of the infinite polynomial.
"
18192,"What sequence is represented by the generating series 3 + 82 + 3 + 5
7 +
1006 +   ?
Solution.
"
18193,We just read off the coefficients of each term.
18194,"So 0 = 3 since
the coefficient of 0 is 3 (0 = 1"
18195,so this is the constant term).
18196,What is 1?
18197,"It
is NOT 8, since 8 is the coefficient of 2, so 8 is the term 2 of the sequence.
"
18198,To find 1 we need to look for the coefficient of 1 which in this case is 0.
18199,"So
1 = 0."
18200,"Continuing, we have 2 = 8, 3 = 1, 4 = 0, and 5 = 1
7."
18201,"So we have the
sequence
3, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1

sequence with 0.
"
18204,"Now you might very naturally ask why we would do such a thing.
"
18205,"One
reason is that encoding a sequence with a power series helps us keep track of
which term is which in the sequence.
"
18206,"For example, if we write the sequence
1, 3, 4, 6, 9, . . ."
18207,", 24, 41, . . ."
18208,"it is impossible to determine which term 24 is (even if we
agreed that the first term was supposed to be 0)."
18209,"However, if we wrote the generating
series instead, we would have 1+3+42 +63 +94 +   +2417"
18210,+4118 +  .
18211,"Now
it is clear that 24 is the 17th term of the sequence (that is, 17 = 24)."
18212,"Of course to get
this benefit we could have displayed our sequence in any number of ways, perhaps
1 0 3 1 4 2 6 3 9 4    24 17 41 18   , but we do not do this."
18213,"The reason is that the
generating series looks like an ordinary power series (although we are interpreting
it differently) so we can do things with it that we ordinarily do with power series
such as w"
18214,"For example, from calculus we know that the power series 1 + + 2

Building Generating Functions

18219,The example is very specific.

we know its generating function is because we happen to know the Taylor series
for . Our goal now is to gather some tools to build the generating fun"
18221,Lets see what the generating functions are for some very simple sequences.
18222,"The
simplest of all: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . ."
18223,What does the generating series look like?
18224,"It is simply
1 + + 2 + 3 + 4 +   ."
18225,"Now, can we find a closed formula for this power series?
"
18226,This particular series is really just a geometric series with common ratio .
18227,"So if
we use our multiply, shift and subtract technique from Section 4.4, we have

Solving Recurrence Relations with Generating Functions

functions is helpful."

Solve the recurrence relation = 31 22 with initial conditions 0 = 1
and 1 = 3.
Solution.
"

Introduction to Number Theory
We have used the natural numbers to solve problems."
18443,"This was the right set of
numbers to work with in discrete mathematics because we always dealt with a whole
number of things."
18444,The natural numbers have been a tool.
18445,"Lets take a moment now
to inspect that tool."
18446,"What mathematical discoveries can we make about the natural
numbers themselves?
"
18447,"This is the main question of number theory: a huge, ancient, complex, and above
all, beautiful branch of mathematics."
18448,"Historically, number theory was known as the
Queen of Mathematics and was very much a branch of pure mathematics, studied for
its own sake instead of as a means to understanding real-world application"
18449,"This
has changed in recent years however, as applications of number theory have been
unearthed."
18450,"Probably the most well-known example of this is RSA cryptography, one
of the methods used to encrypt data on the internet."
18451,"It is number theory that makes
this possible.
"
18452,"What sorts of questions belong to the realm of number theory?
"
18453,"Here is a
motivating example."
18454,"Recall in our study of induction, we asked:
Which amounts of postage can be made exactly using just 5-cent and
8-cent stamps?
"
18455,We were able to prove that any amount greater than 27 cents could be made.
18456,"You
might wonder what would happen if we changed the denomination of the stamps.
"
18457,What if we instead had 4- and 9-cent stamps?
18458,"Would there be some amount after
which all amounts would be possible?"
18459,"Well, again, we could replace two 4-cent
stamps with a 9-cent stamp, or three 9-cent stamps with seven 4-cent stamps."
18460,"In each
case we can create one more cent of postage."
18461,"Using this as the inductive case would
allow us to prove that any amount of postage greater than 23 cents can be made.
"
18462,What if we had 2-cent and 4-cent stamps.
18463,Here it looks less promising.
18464,"If we
take some number of 2-cent stamps and some number of 4-cent stamps, what can
we say about the total?"
18465,Could it ever be odd?
18466,"Doesnt look like it.
"
18467,"Why does 5 and 8 work, 4 and 9 work, but 2 and 4 not work?"
18468,"What is it about
these numbers?"
18469,"If I gave you a pair of numbers, could you tell me right away if
they would work or not?"
18470,"We will answer these questions, and more, after first
investigating some simpler properties of numbers themselves.
"
18471,"6.2.1
Divisibility
It is easy to add and multiply natural numbers."
18472,"If we extend our focus to all integers,
then subtraction is also easy (we need the negative numbers, so we can subtract
any number from any other number, even larger from smaller)."
18473,"Division is the first
operation that presents a challenge."
18474,"If we wanted to extend our set of numbers so
any division would be possible (maybe excluding division by 0), we would need to
look at the rational numbers (the set of all numbers that can be written a"
18475,"This would be going too far, so we will refuse this option.
"
18476,"Introduction to Number Theory

In fact, it is a good thing that not every number can be divided by other numbers.
"
18477,"This helps us understand the structure of the natural numbers and opens the door
to many interesting questions and applications.

For example, lets try this to decide whether 1642 | 136299."
18512,"Start finding multiples

"
18513,All of these are well less than 136299.

18516,"80 = 131360
1642  85 = 139570.

18518,"Try 83:
1642  83 = 136286.
"
18519,Is this the best we can do?
18520,How far are we from our desired 136299?
18521,"If we
subtract, we get 136299 136286 = 13."
18522,"So we know we cannot go up to 84; that will
be too much."
18523,"In other words, we have found that
136299 = 83  1642 + 13.
"
18524,"Since 13 < 1642, we can now safely say that 1642 136299.

18526,"We can always write the number as some multiple of the number plus
some remainder."
18527,"We know this because we know about division with remainder
from elementary school."
18528,This is just a way of saying it using multiplication.

to the procedural nature that can be used to find the remainder, this fact is usually
called the division algorithm:

Remainder Classes
The division algorithm tells us that there are only possible remainders when
dividing by ."
18534,"If we fix this divisor, we can group integers by the remainder."
18535,"Each
group is called a remainder class modulo (or sometimes residue class).
"
18536,"Example 6.2.2
Describe the remainder classes modulo 5.
Solution.
"
18537,"We want to classify numbers by what their remainder would be
when divided by 5."
18538,"From the division algorithm, we know there will be
exactly 5 remainder classes, because there are only 5 choices for what could

careful: 6 does NOT have remainder 1."
18549,"We can write 6 = 2  5 + 4 or
6 = 1  5 1, but only one of these is a correct instance of the division

18560,"Additional Topics
Note that in the example above, every integer is in exactly one remainder class.
"
18561,"The technical way to say this is that the remainder classes modulo form a partition
of the integers.1 The most important fact about partitions is that it is possible to
define an equivalence relation "
18562,"If two numbers belong
to the same remainder class, then in some way, they are the same."
18563,"That is, they are
the same up to division by ."
18564,"In the case where = 5 above, the numbers 8 and 23,
while not the same number, are the same when it comes to dividing by 5, because
both have remainder 3.
"
18565,"It matters what the divisor is: 8 and 23 are the same up to division by 5, but not
up to division by 7, since 8 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7 while 23 has a
remainder of 2.

18566,"With all this in mind, lets introduce some notation."

23 are basically the same, even though they are not equal."
18568,"It would be wrong to
say 8 = 23."
18569,"Instead, we write 8 23."
18570,But this is not always true.
18571,"It works if we are
thinking division by 5, so we need to denote that somehow."
18572,"What we will actually
write is this:
8 23
(mod 5)

Properties of Congruence
We said earlier that congruence modulo behaves, in many important ways, the
same way equ"
18594,"Specifically, we could prove that congruence modulo is
an equivalence relation, which would require checking the following three facts:
Congruence Modulo is an Equivalence Relation.

hold:

3."
18598,"If (mod ) and (mod ), then (mod ).
"
18599,"In other words, congruence modulo is reflexive, symmetric, and transi-
tive, and so is an equivalence relation.
"
18600,"You should take a minute to convince yourself that each of the properties above
actually holds for congruence."
18601,"Try explaining each using both the remainder and
divisibility definitions.
"
18602,"Next, consider how congruence behaves when doing basic arithmetic."
18603,"We already
know that if you subtract two congruent numbers, the result will be congruent
to 0 (be a multiple of )."
18604,"What if we add something congruent to 1 to something
congruent to 2?"
18605,"Will we get something congruent to 3?
Congruence and Arithmetic.

18606,Suppose (mod ) and (mod ).

1."
18608,"+ + (mod ).
"
18609,"2. (mod ).
"
18610,"3. (mod ).
"
18611,"The above facts might be written a little strangely, but the idea is simple."
18612,"If we
have a true congruence, and we add the same thing to both sides, the result is still a
true congruence."
18613,"This sounds like we are saying:
If (mod ) then + + (mod ).
"
18614,"Of course this is true as well; it is the special case where = . But what we have
works in more generality."
18615,Think of congruence as being basically equal.
18616,"If we
have two numbers that are basically equal, and we add basically the same thing to
both sides, the result will be basically equal.
"
18617,This seems reasonable.
18618,Is it really true?
18619,"Lets prove the first fact:
Proof."
18620,Suppose (mod ) and (mod ).
18621,That means =
18622,"+ and
= + for integers and ."
18623,"Add these equations:

18625,"But + = (+ ), which is just a multiple of . So + = +"
18626,"+ ),
or in other words, + + (mod ).
"
18627,"The other two facts can be proved in a similar way.
"
18628,"One of the important consequences of these facts about congruences is that
we can basically replace any number in a congruence with any other number it is
congruent to."
18629,"Here are some examples to see how (and why) that works:

6.2."
18630,"Introduction to Number Theory

Example 6.2.3
Find the remainder of 3491 divided by 9.
Solution.
"
18631,"We could do long division, but there is another way."
18632,"We want
to find such that 3491 (mod 9)."
18633,Now 3491 = 3000 + 400 + 90 + 1.
18634,"Of
course 90 0 (mod 9), so we can replace the 90 in the sum with 0."
18635,"Why is
this okay?"
18636,"We are actually subtracting the same thing from both sides:
3000 + 400 + 90 + 1
(mod 9)
0 90
(mod 9)
3000 + 400"
18637,"+ 1
(mod 9).
"
18638,"Next, note that 400 = 4  100, and 100 1 (mod 9) (since 9 | 99)."
18639,"So we
can in fact replace the 400 with simply a 4."
18640,"Again, we are appealing to our
claim that we can replace congruent elements, but we are really appealing to
property 3 about the arithmetic of congruence: We know 100 1 (mod 9), so
if we multiply both"
18641,"Similarly, we can replace 3000 with 3, since 1000 = 1 + 999 1 (mod 9).
"
18642,"So our original congruence becomes
3 + 4 + 0"
18643,"+ 1
(mod 9)
8
(mod 9).
"
18644,"Therefore 3491 divided by 9 has remainder 8.
"
18645,"The above example should convince you that the well-known divisibility test for
9 is true: The sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the original
number is divisible by 9."
18646,"In fact, we now know something more: Any number is
congruent to the sum of its digits, modulo 9.3
Lets try another.
"
18647,"Example 6.2.4
Find the remainder when 3123 is divided by 7.

18648,"Of course, we are working with congruence because we want
to find the smallest positive such that 3123 (mod 7)."
18649,"Now first write
3123 = (33)41."
18650,"We have:
3123 = 2741 641

since 27 6 (mod 7)."

about division?"

factors, so we get

18686,"6.2.4
Solving Congruences
Now that we have some algebraic rules to govern congruence relations, we can
attempt to solve for an unknown in a congruence."
18687,"For example, is there a value of 
that satisfies,
3+ 2 4
(mod 5),
and if so, what is it?
"
18688,"In this example, since the modulus is small, we could simply try every possible
value for . There are really only 5 to consider, since any integer that satisfied the
congruence could be replaced with "
18689,"Here, when = 4 we get 3+ 2 = 14, which is indeed congruent to 4 modulo 5.
"
18690,"This means that = 9 and = 14 and = 19 and so on will each also be a solution
because, as we saw above, replacing any number in a congruence with a congruent
number does not change the truth of the con"
18691,"So in this example, simply compute 3+ 2 for values of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}."
18692,"This
gives 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 respectively, for which only 14 is congruent to 4.
Lets also see how you could solve this using our rules for the algebra of
congruences."
18693,"Such an approach would be much simpler than the trial and error
tactic if the modulus was larger."
18694,"First, we know we can subtract 2 from both sides:
32
(mod 5).
"
18695,"Then to divide both sides by 3, we first add 0 to both sides."
18696,"Of course, on the
right-hand side, we want that 0 to be a 10 (yes, 10 really is 0 since they are congruent
modulo 5)."
18697,"This gives,
312
(mod 5).
"
18698,Now divide both sides by 3.
18699,"Since gcd(3, 5) = 1, we do not need to change the
modulus:
4
(mod 5).
"
18700,"Notice that this in fact gives the general solution: Not only can = 4, but can be
any number which is congruent to 4."
18701,"We can leave it like this, or write = 4 + 5
for any integer .

3. 2023 (mod 14).
"
18704,All we need to do here is divide both sides by 7.
18705,"We add 13 to the
right-hand side repeatedly until we get a multiple of 7 (adding 13 is the
same as adding 0, so this is legal)."
18706,"We get 25, 38, 51, 64, 77  got it."
18707,"So
we have:
712
(mod 13)
777
(mod 13)
11
(mod 13).
"
18708,"Here, since we have numbers larger than the modulus, we can reduce
them prior to applying any algebra."
18709,"We have 84 9, 38 8 and 79 4.
"
18710,"Thus,
8438 79
(mod 15)
98 4
(mod 15)
912
(mod 15)
972
(mod 15).
"
18711,"We got the 72 by adding 0 60 (mod 15) to both sides of the congruence.
"
18712,Now divide both sides by 9.
18713,"However, since gcd(9, 15) = 3, we must
divide the modulus by 3 as well:
8
(mod 5).
"
18714,"So the solutions are those values that are congruent to 8, or equivalently
3, modulo 5."
18715,"This means that in some sense there are 3 solutions modulo
15: 3, 8, and 13."
18716,"We can write the solution:
3
(mod 15);"
18717,"8
(mod 15); 13

3."
18718,"First, reduce modulo 14:
2023
(mod 14)
69

"
18719,"We could now divide both sides by 3 or try to increase 9 by a multiple
of 14 to get a multiple of 6."
18720,"If we divide by 3, we get,
23
(mod 14).
"
18721,"Now try adding multiples of 14 to 3, in hopes of getting a number we
can divide by 2."
18722,This will not work!
18723,"Every time we add 14 to the right
side, the result will still be odd."
18724,"We will never get an even number, so
we will never be able to divide by 2."
18725,"Thus there are no solutions to the
congruence.

The last congruence above illustrates the way in which congruences might not
have solutions."
18727,We could have seen this immediately in fact.
18728,"Look at the original
congruence:
2023
(mod 14).
"
18729,"If we write this as an equation, we get
20= 23 + 14,
or equivalently 2014= 23."
18730,"We can easily see there will be no solution to this
equation in integers."
18731,"The left-hand side will always be even, but the right-hand side
is odd."
18732,"A similar problem would occur if the right-hand side was divisible by any
number that the left-hand side was not.
"
18733,"So in general, given the congruence

(mod ),
if and are divisible by a number by which is not divisible, then there will be no
solutions."
18734,"In fact, we really only need to check one divisor of and : the greatest
common divisor."

Congruences with No Solutions.

Solving Linear Diophantine Equations
Discrete math deals with whole numbers of things."
18738,"So when we want to solve
equations, we usually are looking for integer solutions."
18739,"Equations that are intended
to only have integer solutions were first studied by in the third century by the
Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria, and as such are called Diophantine
equations."
18740,"Probably the most famous example of a Diophantine equation is 2+2 = 2.
"
18741,The integer solutions to this equation are called Pythagorean triples.
18742,"In general,
solving Diophantine equations is hard (in fact, there is provably no general algorithm
for deciding whether a Diophantine equation has a solution, a result known as
Matiyasevichs Theorem)."
18743,"We will restrict our focus to linear Diophantine equations,
which are considerably easier to work with.
"
18744,"An equation in two or more variables is called a Diophantine equation if
only integer solutions are of interest."
18745,"A linear Diophantine equation takes
the form 11 + 2+    + = for constants 1, . ."
18746,", , .
A solution to a Diophantine equation is a solution to the equation consist-
ing only of integers.

"
18747,"Additional Topics
We have the tools we need to solve linear Diophantine equations."
18748,"We will
consider, as a main example, the equation
51+ 87= 123.
"
18749,"The general strategy will be to convert the equation to a congruence, and then
solve that congruence.4 Lets work through this particular example to see how this
might go.
"
18750,"First, check if perhaps there are no solutions because a divisor of 51 and 87 is
not a divisor of 123."
18751,"Really, we just need to check whether gcd(51, 87) | 123."
18752,"This
greatest common divisor is 3, and yes 3 | 123."
18753,"At this point, we might as well factor
out this greatest common divisor."
18754,"So instead, we will solve:
17+ 29= 41.
"
18755,"Now observe that if there are going to be solutions, then for those values of 
and , the two sides of the equation must have the same remainder as each other, no
matter what we divide by."
18756,"In particular, if we divide both sides by 17, we must get
the same remainder."
18757,"Thus we can safely write
17+ 2941
(mod 17).
"
18758,We choose 17 because 17will have remainder 0.
18759,"This will allow us to reduce the
congruence to just one variable."
18760,"We could have also moved to a congruence modulo
29, although there is usually a good reason to select the smaller choice, as this will
allow us to reduce the other coefficient."
18761,"In our case, we reduce the congruence as
follows:
17+ 2941
(mod 17)
0+ 127
(mod 17)
1224
(mod 17)
2
(mod 17).
"
18762,Now at this point we know =
18763,2 + 17will work for any integer .
18764,"If we havent
made a mistake, we should be able to plug this back into our original Diophantine
equation to find :

18768,2 + 17will satisfy the equation.
18769,"We could check this for a few
cases."

is (88, 53)."

20582,"Preface
This book helps students to master the material of a standard US undergraduate
rst course in Linear Algebra.
"
20583,"The material is standard in that the subjects covered are Gaussian reduction,
vector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
"
20584,"Another standard is the books audience: sophomores or juniors, usually with
a background of at least one semester of calculus."
20585,"The help that it gives to
students comes from taking a developmental approach  this books presentation
emphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.
"
20586,"The developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will
elaborate."
20587,"Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on
theory and more on calculating."
20588,"Later courses ask for mathematical maturity: the
ability to follow dierent types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that
underlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and f"
20589,"Some programs
have a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear
Algebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition."
20590,"It comes early in a
program so that progress made here pays olater but it also comes late enough
so that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.
"
20591,"The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant."
20592,"And, examples are plentiful.
"
20593,"Helping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seri-
ously."
20594,All of the results here are proved.
20595,"On the other hand, we cannot assume
that students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced
texts this book is lled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed
illustration"
20596,"Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix
multiplication and determinants."
20597,"Then, when vector spaces and linear maps
nally appear and denitions and proofs start, the abrupt change brings the

students to an abrupt stop."
20598,"While this book begins with linear reduction, from
the start we do more than compute."
20599,"The rst chapter includes proofs, such as
the proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set."
20600,"With
that as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals."
20601,"In the
schedule below this happens at the start of the third week.
"
20602,A student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises.
20603,"The problem
sets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs."
20604,"I
have aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection."
20605,"In
particular there is a good number of the medium-dicult problems that stretch
a learner, but not too far."
20606,"At the high end, there are a few that are puzzles taken
from various journals, competitions, or problems collections, which are marked
with a ?"
20607,"(as part of the fun I have worked to keep the original wording).
"
20608,"That is, as with the rest of the book, the exercises are aimed to both build
an ability at, and help students experience the pleasure of, doing mathematics.
"
20609,"Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to picture themselves
doing the same type of work.
"
20610,"Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects of the
subject."
20611,"Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of topics in those
areas."
20612,"These give a reader a taste of the subject, discuss how Linear Algebra
comes in, point to some further reading, and give a few exercises."
20613,"They are
brief enough that an instructor can do one in a days class or can assign them
as projects for individuals or small groups."
20614,"Whether they gure formally in a
course or not, they help readers see for themselves that Linear Algebra is a tool
that a professional must have.

"
20620,"A lesson of software development is that complex projects
have bugs and need a process to x them."
20621,"I am grateful for reports from both
instructors and students."
20622,"I periodically issue revisions and acknowledge in the
books repository all of the reports that I use."
20623,"My current contact information

"
20624,"I am grateful to Saint Michaels College for supporting this project over many
years, even before the idea of open educational resources became familiar.
"
20625,"And, I cannot thank my wife Lynne enough for her unagging encouragement.

Advice."
20626,"This books emphasis on motivation and development, and its availability,
make it widely used for self-study."
20627,"If you are an independent student then good
for you, I admire your industry."
20628,"However, you may nd some advice useful.
"
20629,"While an experienced instructor knows what subjects and pace suit their
class, this semesters timetable (graciously shared by G Ashline) may help you
plan a sensible rate."

20645,"As enrichment, you could pick one or two extra things that appeal to you, from
the lab manual or from the Topics from the end of each chapter."
20646,"I like the Topics
on Voting Paradoxes, Geometry of Linear Maps, and Coupled Oscillators."
20647,"Youll
get more from these if you have access to software for calculations such as Sage,
freely available from http://sagemath.org.
"
20648,"In the table of contents I have marked a few subsections as optional if some
instructors will pass over them in favor of spending more time elsewhere.
"
20649,"Note that in addition to the in-class exams, students in the above course do
take-home problem sets that include proofs, such as a verication that a set is a
vector space."
20650,"Computations are important but so are the arguments.
"
20651,My main advice is: do many exercises.
20652,"I have marked a good sample with
s in the margin."
20653,"Do not simply read the answers  you must try the problems
and possibly struggle with them."
20654,"For all of the exercises, you must justify your
answer either with a computation or with a proof."
20655,"Be aware that few people
can write correct proofs without training; try to nd a knowledgeable person to
work with you.

"
20656,"Finally, a caution for all students, independent or not: I cannot overemphasize
that the statement, I understand the material but it is only that I have trouble
with the problems shows a misconception"
20657,"Being able to do things with the
ideas is their entire point."
20658,"The quotes below express this sentiment admirably (I
have taken the liberty of formatting them as poetry)."
20659,"They capture the essence
of both the beauty and the power of mathematics and science in general, and of
Linear Algebra in particular.
"
20660,"I know of no better tactic
than the illustration of exciting principles
by well-chosen particulars.

Linear Systems

Solving Linear Systems
Systems of linear equations are common in science and mathematics."
20760,"These two
examples from high school science [Onan] give a sense of how they arise.
"
20761,The rst example is from Statics.
20762,"Suppose that we have three objects, we
know that one has a mass of 2 kg, and we want to nd the two unknown masses.
"

For the masses to balance we must have that the sum of moments on the left
equals the sum of moments on the right, where the moment of an object is its
mass times its dis"
20765,"That gives a system of two
linear equations.
"
20766,"40h + 15c = 100
25c = 50 + 50h
The second example is from Chemistry.
"
20767,"We can mix, under controlled
conditions, toluene C7H8 and nitric acid HNO3 to produce trinitrotoluene
C7H5O6N3 along with the byproduct water (conditions have to be very well
controlled  trinitrotolue"
20768,"In what proportion should
we mix them?"

Chapter One."
20770,"Linear Systems
must equal the number present afterward."
20771,"Applying that in turn to the elements
C, H, N, and O gives this system.
"
20772,"7x = 7z
8x + 1y = 5z + 2w
1y = 3z
3y = 6z + 1w
Both examples come down to solving a system of equations."
20773,"In each system,
the equations involve only the rst power of each variable."
20774,"This chapter shows
how to solve any such system of equations.
"
20775,"I.1
Gausss Method
1.1 Denition A linear combination of x1, . ."
20776,", xn has the form

20780,", xn has the form a1x1"
20781,"+ a3x3 +    +

"
20782,"An n-tuple (s1, s2, . ."
20783,", sn) Rn is a solution of, or satises, that equation
if substituting the numbers s1, . . ."
20784,", sn for the variables gives a true statement:

20785,"+ a2s2 +    + ansn = d. A system of linear equations

am,1x1 + am,2x2 +    + am,nxn = dm
has the solution (s1, s2, . . ."
20787,", sn) if that n-tuple is a solution of all of the equations.
"
20788,1.2 Example The combination 3x1 + 2x2 of x1 and x2 is linear.
20789,"The combination
3x2
1 + 2x2 is not a linear function of x1 and x2, nor is 3x1 + 2 sin(x2).
"
20790,"We usually take x1, . . ."
20791,", xn to be unequal to each other because in a
sum with repeats we can rearrange to make the elements unique, as with
2x + 3y + 4x = 6x + 3y."
20792,"We sometimes include terms with a zero coecient, as
in x 2y + 0z, and at other times omit them, depending on what is convenient.

"
20793,"Section I. Solving Linear Systems

1.3 Example The ordered pair (1, 5) is a solution of this system.
"
20794,"3x1 + 2x2 = 7
x1 +"
20795,"x2 = 6
In contrast, (5, 1) is not a solution.
"
20796,Finding the set of all solutions is solving the system.
20797,"We dont need guesswork
or good luck; there is an algorithm that always works."
20798,"This algorithm is Gausss
Method (or Gaussian elimination or linear elimination).
"
20799,"1.4 Example To solve this system
3x3 = 9
x1 + 5x2 2x3 = 2
1
3x1 + 2x2
= 3
we transform it, step by step, until it is in a form that we can easily solve.
"
20800,"The rst transformation rewrites the system by interchanging the rst and
third row.
"
20801,"swap row 1 with row 3

1
3x1 + 2x2
= 3
x1 + 5x2 2x3 = 2
3x3 = 9
The second transformation rescales the rst row by a factor of 3.
"
20802,"multiply row 1 by 3

x1 + 6x2
= 9
x1 + 5x2 2x3 = 2
3x3 = 9
The third transformation is the only nontrivial one in this example."
20803,"We mentally
multiply both sides of the rst row by 1, mentally add that to the second row,
and write the result in as the new second row.
"
20804,"add 1 times row 1 to row 2

x1 + 6x2
=
9
x2 2x3 = 7
3x3 =
9
These steps have brought the system to a form where we can easily nd the
value of each variable."
20805,The bottom equation shows that x3 = 3.
20806,"Substituting 3
for x3 in the middle equation shows that x2 = 1."
20807,"Substituting those two into
the top equation gives that x1 = 3."
20808,"Thus the system has a unique solution; the
solution set is {(3, 1, 3)}.
"
20809,We will use Gausss Method throughout the book.
20810,It is fast and easy.
20811,"We
will now show that it is also safe: Gausss Method never loses solutions nor does
it ever pick up extraneous solutions, so that a tuple is a solution to the system
before we apply the method if and "

20813,"Linear Systems
1.5 Theorem (Gausss Method)"
20814,"If a linear system is changed to another by one of
these operations
(1) an equation is swapped with another
(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant
(3) an equation is replaced "
20815,Each of the three operations has a restriction.
20816,"Multiplying a row by 0 is not
allowed because obviously that can change the solution set."
20817,"Similarly, adding a
multiple of a row to itself is not allowed because adding 1 times the row to
itself has the eect of multiplying the row by 0."
20818,"And we disallow swapping a
row with itself, to make some results in the fourth chapter easier."
20819,"Besides, its
pointless.
"
20820,Proof We will cover the equation swap operation here.
20821,"The other two cases
are similar and are Exercise 33.
"
20822,"Consider a linear system.
"
20823,"a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 +   "
20824,"+ a1,nxn = d1
...

20825,"+ ai,2x2 +    + ai,nxn = di
...
"
20826,"aj,1x1 + aj,2x2 +    + aj,nxn = dj
...
am,1x1 + am,2x2 +    + am,nxn = dm
The tuple (s1, . . ."
20827,", sn) satises this system if and only if substituting the values
for the variables, the ss for the xs, gives a conjunction of true statements:
a1,1s1+a1,2s2+  +a1,nsn = d1 and . . ."
20828,"ai,1s1+ai,2s2+  +ai,nsn = di and
. . ."
20829,"+aj,2s2 +  +aj,nsn = dj and . . ."
20830,"+am,2s2 +  +am,nsn =
dm.
"
20831,"In a list of statements joined with and we can rearrange the order of the
statements."
20832,"Thus this requirement is met if and only if a1,1s1 + a1,2s2 +    +
a1,nsn = d1 and . . ."
20833,"+aj,2s2 +  +aj,nsn = dj and . . ."
20834,"+ai,2s2 +
  +ai,nsn = di and . . ."
20835,"+am,2s2 +  +am,nsn = dm."
20836,"This is exactly
the requirement that (s1, . . ."

1.6 Denition The three operations from Theorem 1.5 are the elementary re-
duction operations, or row operations, or Gaussian operations."
20839,"They are
swapping, multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling), and row combination.
"
20840,"When writing out the calculations, we will abbreviate row i by i (this is
the Greek letter rho, pronounced aloud as row)."
20841,"For instance, we will denote
a row combination operation by ki + j, with the row that changes written
second."
20842,"To save writing we will often combine addition steps when they use the
same i, as in the next example.
"
20843,"1.7 Example Gausss Method systematically applies the row operations to solve
a system."
20844,"Here is a typical case.
"
20845,"x + y
= 0
2x y + 3z = 3
x 2y z = 3
We begin by using the rst row to eliminate the 2x in the second row and the x
in the third."
20846,"To get rid of the 2x we mentally multiply the entire rst row by
2, add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row.
"
20847,"To eliminate the x in the third row we multiply the rst row by 1, add that to
the third row, and write the result in as the new third row.
"
20848,"21+2

1+3
x +
y
= 0
3y + 3z = 3
3y z"
20849,"= 3
We nish by transforming the second system into a third, where the bottom
equation involves only one unknown."
20850,"We do that by using the second row to
eliminate the y term from the third row.
2+3

x +
y
= 0
3y +
3z = 3
4z = 0
Now nding the systems solution is easy."
20851,The third row gives z = 0.
20852,"Substitute
that back into the second row to get y = 1."
20853,"Then substitute back into the rst
row to get x"
20854,"1.8 Example For the Physics problem from the start of this chapter, Gausss
Method gives this.
40h + 15c = 100
50h + 25c = 50
5/41+2

40h +
15c = 100
(175/4)c = 175
"
20855,"So c = 4, and back-substitution gives that h ="

reduction operations to set up back-substitution.

is the rows leading variable."

Strictly speaking, to solve linear systems we dont need the row rescaling
operation."
20872,"We have introduced it here because it is convenient and because we
will use it later in this chapter as part of a variation of Gausss Method, the
Gauss-Jordan Method.
"
20873,"All of the systems so far have the same number of equations as unknowns.
"
20874,All of them have a solution and for all of them there is only one solution.
20875,"We
nish this subsection by seeing other things that can happen.

20880,"The 0 = 0 reects the redundancy.
"
20881,"Gausss Method is also useful on systems with more variables than equations.
"
20882,"The next subsection has many examples.
"
20883,"Another way that linear systems can dier from the examples shown above
is that some linear systems do not have a unique solution."
20884,"This can happen in
two ways."
20885,"The rst is that a system can fail to have any solution at all.

is not what causes the inconsistency  Example 1.12 has more equations than

necessary for inconsistency, as we see with this inconsistent system that has the

20897,"Later we will have more to
say about dependencies between a systems parts.
"
20898,"The other way that a linear system can fail to have a unique solution, besides
having no solutions, is to have many solutions.

back substitution."
20917,"If any step shows a contradictory equation then we can stop
with the conclusion that the system has no solutions."
20918,"If we reach echelon form
without a contradictory equation, and each variable is a leading variable in its
row, then the system has a unique solution and we nd it by back substitution.
"
20919,"Finally, if we reach echelon form without a contradictory equation, and there is
not a unique solution  that is, at least one variable is not a leading variable 
then the system has many solutions.
"
20920,The next subsection explores the third case.

must have innitely many solutions and we will describe the solution set.

Describing the Solution Set
A linear system with a unique solution has a solution set with one element."
21017,"A
linear system with no solution has a solution set that is empty."
21018,"In these cases
the solution set is easy to describe."

when they contain many elements.

21021,"Theorem 1.5 shows that an (x, y, z)
satises the rst system if and only if it satises the third."
21022,"So we can describe
the solution set {(x, y, z) | 2x + z = 3 and x y z = 1 and 3x y = 4} in this
way.
"
21023,"{(x, y, z) | 2x + z = 3 and y 3z/2 = 1/2}
()
"
21024,"This description is better because it has two equations instead of three but it is
not optimal because it still has some hard to understand interactions among the
variables.
"
21025,"To improve it, use the variable that does not lead any equation, z, to describe
the variables that do lead, x and y."
21026,"The second equation gives y = (1/2)(3/2)z
and the rst equation gives x = (3/2)(1/2)z."
21027,"Thus we can describe the solution
set as this set of triples.
"
21028,"{((3/2) (1/2)z, (1/2) (3/2)z, z) | z R}
()
Compared with (), the advantage of () is that z can be any real number.
"
21029,"This makes the job of deciding which tuples are in the solution set much easier.
"
21030,"For instance, taking z = 2 shows that (1/2, 5/2, 2) is a solution.

20
Chapter One."
21136,"Linear Systems
Weve noted that the solution sets described in this way have innitely many
members so answering this question would tell us about the size of solution sets.
"
21137,The following subsection shows that the answer is yes.
21138,"This chapters second
section then uses that answer to describe the geometry of solution sets.
"
21139,"Other questions arise from the observation that we can do Gausss Method
in more than one way (for instance, when swapping rows we may have a choice
of rows to swap with)."
21140,"Theorem 1.5 says that we must get the same solution set
no matter how we proceed but if we do Gausss Method in two ways must we
get the same number of free variables in each echelon form system?"
21141,"Must those
be the same variables, that is, is it impossible to solve a problem one way to get
y and w free and solve it another way to get y and z free?"
21142,"The third section
of this chapter answers yes, that from any starting linear system, all derived
echelon form versions have the same free variables.
"

the practice of Gausss Method but we will also have a solid grounding in the
theory."

the system, using the equations from lower rows to do the next row."

to doing the proof by mathematical induction.

use a number of times in this book."

statement is true for some rst instance, here that for the bottom equation we
can write the leading variable in terms of free variables."

we must establish an implication, that if the statement is true for all prior cases

the lemma is trivially true because there are no leading variables)."
21276,"But because
the system is homogeneous there are no contradictory equations.
"
21277,"We will use induction to verify that each leading variable can be expressed
in terms of free variables."
21278,"That will nish the proof because we can use the free
variables as parameters and the s are the vectors of coecients of those free

21280,"(Here  stands for leading so that xm is the leading
variable in row m.)"

21282,"Move these to the right hand side and divide by am,m

21285,"For the inductive step assume that the statement holds for the bottom-most
t rows, with 0 t < m 1."
21286,"That is, assume that for the m-th equation, and
the (m 1)-th equation, etc., up to and including the (m t)-th equation, we
can express the leading variable in terms of free ones."
21287,"We must verify that
this then also holds for the next equation up, the (m (t + 1))-th equation.
"
21288,"For that, take each variable that leads in a lower equation xm, . . . , xmt and
substitute its expression in terms of free variables."
21289,"We only need expressions
for leading variables from lower equations because the system is in echelon
form, so the leading variables in equations above this one do not appear in
this equation."
21290,"The result has a leading term of am(t+1),m(t+1)xm(t+1)
with am(t+1),m(t+1) = 0, and the rest of the left hand side is a linear
combination of free variables."

by am(t+1),m(t+1) to end with this equations leading variable xm(t+1) in
terms of free variables.

vector as having some length and pointing in some direction.

magnitude and a direction  these
are equal, even though they start in dierent places They are equal because they
have equal "
21416,"Again: those vectors are not just alike,
they are equal.
"
21417,How can things that are in dierent places be equal?
21418,"Think of a vector as
representing a displacement (the word vector is Latin for carrier or traveler).
"
21419,"These two squares undergo displacements that are equal despite that they start
in dierent places.
"
21420,"When we want to emphasize this property vectors have of not being anchored
we refer to them as free vectors."
21421,"Thus, these free vectors are equal, as each is a
displacement of one over and two up.
"

same change in rst components and the same change in second components: the
vector extending from (a1, a2) to (b1, b2) eq"

"
21424,"Saying the vector that, were it to start at (a1, a2), would extend to (b1, b2)
would be unwieldy."

The long arrow is the combined displacement in this sense: imagine that you are
walking on a ships deck."
21441,"Suppose that in one minute the ships motion gives it
a displacement relative to the sea of v, and in the same minute your walking
gives you a displacement relative to the ships deck of w."
21442,"Then v + w is your
displacement relative to the sea.
"
21443,"Another way to understand the vector sum is with the parallelogram rule.

"

rows of G reordered and each row of B is a linear combination of the rows of G.

We now have the insight that Gausss Method builds linear combinations

21796,"That is, Gausss Method has made
x5s row in some way independent of x1s row.
"
21797,The following result makes this intuition precise.
21798,"We sometimes refer to
Gausss Method as Gaussian elimination."
21799,"What it eliminates is linear relation-
ships among the rows.
"
21800,"2.5 Lemma In an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination
of the other nonzero rows.
"
21801,Proof Let R be an echelon form matrix and consider its non-0 rows.
21802,"First
observe that if we have a row written as a combination of the others i =
c11 +  +ci1i1 +ci+1i+1 +  +cmm then we can rewrite that equation
as
0 = c11 +   "
21803,+ ci1i1 + cii + ci+1i+1 +   
21804,"+ cmm
()
where not all the coecients are zero; specically, ci = 1."
21805,"The converse holds
also: given equation () where some ci = 0 we could express i as a combination
of the other rows by moving cii to the left and dividing by ci."
21806,"Therefore we
will have proved the theorem if we show that in () all of the coecients are 0.
"
21807,"For that we use induction on the row number i.
"
21808,The base case is the rst row
21809,"i = 1 (if there is no such nonzero row, so that
R is the zero matrix, then the lemma holds vacuously)."
21810,"Let i be the column
number of the leading entry in row i. Consider the entry of each row that is in
column 1."
21811,"Equation () gives this.
0"
21812,"= c1r1,1 + c2r2,1 +   "

()
"
21814,"The matrix is in echelon form so every row after the rst has a zero entry in that
column r2,1 =    = rm,1 = 0."
21815,"Thus equation () shows that c1 = 0, because
r1,1 = 0 as it leads the row.
"
21816,"The inductive step is much the same as the base step.
"
21817,"Again consider
equation ()."
21818,"We will prove that if the coecient ci is 0 for each row index

21823,ck are all 0
21824,"so this reduces to the equation
0 = ck+1rk+1,k+1 +    + cmrm,k+1."
21825,"The matrix is in echelon form so the
entries rk+2,k+1, . . ."
21826,", rm,k+1 are all 0."
21827,"Thus ck+1 = 0, because rk+1,k+1 = 0
as it is the leading entry.
"
21828,"QED
With that, we are ready to show that the end product of Gauss-Jordan
reduction is unique.
"
21829,"2.6 Theorem Each matrix is row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon form
matrix.
"
21830,[Yuster] Fix a number of rows m.
21831,"We will proceed by induction on the
number of columns n.
"
21832,The base case is that the matrix has n = 1 column.
21833,"If this is the zero matrix
then its echelon form is the zero matrix."
21834,"If instead it has any nonzero entries
then when the matrix is brought to reduced echelon form it must have at least
one nonzero entry, which must be a 1 in the rst row."
21835,"Either way, its reduced
echelon form is unique.
"
21836,"For the inductive step we assume that n > 1 and that all m row matrices
having fewer than n columns have a unique reduced echelon form."
21837,"Consider
an mn matrix A and suppose that B and C are two reduced echelon form
matrices derived from A. We will show that these two must be equal.
"
21838,"Let A be the matrix consisting of the rst n 1 columns of A. Observe
that any sequence of row operations that bring A to reduced echelon form will
also bring A to reduced echelon form."
21839,"By the inductive hypothesis this reduced
echelon form of A is unique, so if B and C dier then the dierence must occur
in column n.
"
21840,"We nish the inductive step and the argument by showing that the two
cannot dier only in that column."

21850,"Weve assumed that bi,n = ci,n and so we get xn = 0."
21851,"Thus xn is not a free
variable and so in () and () the n-th column contains the leading entry of
some row, since in an echelon form matrix any column that does not contain a
leading entry is associate"
21852,"But now, with B and C equal on the rst n 1 columns, by the denition of
reduced echeleon form their leading entries in the n-th column are in the same
row."
21853,"And, both leading entries would have to be 1, and would have to be the
only nonzero entries in that column."
21854,"Therefore B = C.
QED
We have asked whether any two echelon form versions of a linear system have
the same number of free variables, and if so are they exactly the same variables?
"
21855,With the prior result we can answer both questions yes.
21856,"There is no linear
system such that, say, we could apply Gausss Method one way and get y and z
free but apply it another way and get y and w free.
"
21857,"Before the proof, recall the distinction between free variables and parameters.
"
21858,"This system
x + y
= 1
y + z = 2
has one free variable, z, because it is the only variable not leading a row."
21859,"We
have the habit of parametrizing using the free variable y"
21860,"= 2z, x = 1+z, but
we could also parametrize using another variable, such as z = 2 y, x = 1 y.
"
21861,"So the set of parameters is not unique, it is the set of free variables that is
unique.
"
21862,"2.7 Corollary If from a starting linear systems we derive by Gausss Method two
dierent echelon form systems, then the two have the same free variables.
"
21863,Proof The prior result says that the reduced echelon form is unique.
21864,"We get
from any echelon form version to the reduced echelon form by eliminating up, so
any echelon form version of a system has the same free variables as the reduced
echelon form version.

21970,"This years value of the steel used by
others is 17, 389 and the external value of autos is 21, 268."

complete description of how auto and steel interact to meet their demands.

Chapter One."
21973,"Linear Systems
Now imagine that the external demand for steel has recently been going up
by 200 per year and so we estimate that next year it will be 17, 589."
21974,"We also
estimate that next years external demand for autos will be down 25 to 21, 243.
"
21975,"We wish to predict next years total outputs.
"
21976,"That prediction isnt as simple as adding 200 to this years steel total and
subtracting 25 from this years auto total."
21977,"For one thing, a rise in steel will
cause that industry to have an increased demand for autos, which will mitigate
the loss in external demand for autos."
21978,"On the other hand, the drop in external
demand for autos will cause the auto industry to use less steel and so lessen
somewhat the upswing in steels business."
21979,"In short, these two industries form a
system."
21980,"We must predict where the system as a whole will settle.
"
21981,"Here are the equations.
"
21982,"next years production of steel = next years use of steel by steel
+ next years use of steel by auto
+ next years use of steel by others
next years production of autos = next years use of autos by stee"
21983,"For the right side, as discussed above, our external
demand estimates are 17, 589 and 21, 243.
"
21984,"For next years use of steel by steel, note that this year the steel industry
used 5, 395 units of steel input to produce 25, 448 units of steel output."
21985,"So next
year, when the steel industry will produce s units out, we guess that doing so
will take s  (5 395)/(25 448) units of steel input  this is simply the assumption
that input is proportional to o"
21986,"(We are assuming that the ratio of input to
output remains constant over time; in practice, models may try to take account
of trends of change in the ratios.)
"
21987,Next years use of steel by the auto industry is similar.
21988,"This year the auto
industry uses 2, 664 units of steel input to produce 30, 346 units of auto output.
"
21989,"So next year, when the auto industrys total output is a, we expect it to consume
a  (2 664)/(30 346) units of steel.
"

equations.

21995,"Above, we discussed that the prediction of next years totals isnt as simple
as adding 200 to last years steel total and subtracting 25 from last years auto
total."
21996,"Comparing these predictions to the numbers for the current year shows
that the total production of the steel industry should rise by 250 while autos
total drops by 35."
21997,"The increase in external demand for steel causes an increase
in internal demand by the steel industry, which is lessened somewhat by the
drop in autos, but results in a total that is more than 200 hig"
21998,"Similarly,
autos total drops more than 25 despite the help that it gets from steel.
"
21999,"One of the advantages of having a mathematical model is that we can ask
What if . . . ?"
22000,"For instance, we can ask, What if our estimates for
next years external demands are somewhat o?"
22001,"To try to understand how
much the models predictions change in reaction to changes in our estimates,
we can revise the estimate of next years external steel demand from 17, 589
down to 17, 489, while "

how sensitive the predictions of our model are to the accuracy of the assumptions.
"
22006,"Naturally, we can consider larger models that detail the interactions among
more sectors of an economy; these models are typically solved on a computer.

22007,"Naturally also, a single model does not suit every case and assuring that the
assumptions underlying a model are reasonable for a particular prediction
requires the judgments of experts."

Accuracy of Computations
Gausss Method lends itself to computerization."
22034,The code below illustrates.
22035,"It
operates on an nn matrix named a, doing row combinations using the rst
row, then the second row, etc.
for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
multiplier=a[row_"
22036,This is in the C language.
22037,"The for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){ .. } loop initial-
izes row at 1 and then iterates while row is less than or equal to n 1, each
time through incrementing row by one with the ++ operation."
22038,"The other non-
obvious language construct is that the -= in the innermost loop has the eect of
a[row_below,col]=-1*multiplier*a[row,col]+a[row_below,col].
"
22039,"While that code is a rst take on mechanizing Gausss Method, it is naive.
"
22040,"For one thing, it assumes that the entry in the row,row position is nonzero."
22041,"So
one way that it needs to be extended is to cover the case where nding a zero
in that location leads to a row swap or to the conclusion that the matrix is
singular.
"
22042,"We could add some if statements to cover those cases but we will instead
consider another way in which this code is naive."
22043,"It is prone to pitfalls arising
from the computers reliance on oating point arithmetic.
"
22044,"For example, above we have seen that we must handle a singular system as a
separate case."
22045,But systems that are nearly singular also require care.

this one (the extra digits are in the ninth signicant place).

it will represent the second equation internally as 1.000 000 0x+2y = 3.000 0"
22051,"Instead of reporting the correct solution,
this computer will think that the two equations are equal and it will report that
the system is singular.
"
22052,"For some intuition about how the computer could come up with something
that far o, consider this graph of the system.
"
22053,"(1, 1)
We cannot tell the two lines apart; this system is nearly singular in the sense that
the two lines are nearly the same line."
22054,"This gives the system () the property
that a small change in an equation can cause a large change in the solution."
22055,"For
instance, changing the 3.000 000 01 to 3.000 000 03 changes the intersection point
from (1, 1) to (3, 0)."
22056,"The solution changes radically depending on the ninth digit,
which explains why an eight-place computer has trouble."
22057,"A problem that is very
sensitive to inaccuracy or uncertainties in the input values is ill-conditioned.
"
22058,"The above example gives one way in which a system can be dicult to
solve on a computer."
22059,"It has the advantage that the picture of nearly-equal lines
gives a memorable insight into one way for numerical diculties to happen.
"
22060,"Unfortunately this insight isnt useful when we wish to solve some large system.
"
22061,"We typically will not understand the geometry of an arbitrary large system.
"
22062,"There are other ways that a computers results may be unreliable, besides
that the angle between some of the linear surfaces is small."

this system (from [Hamming]).
"

concludes from the rst equation that x = 0."
22075,"The y value is close but the x is
bad  the ratio of the actual answer to the computers answer is innite."
22076,"In
short, another cause of unreliable output is the computers reliance on oating
point arithmetic when the system-solving code leads to using leading entries
that are small.
"
22077,"An experienced programmer may respond by using double precision, which
retains sixteen signicant digits, or perhaps using some even larger size."
22078,"This
will indeed solve many problems."
22079,"However, double precision has greater memory
requirements and besides we can obviously tweak the above to give the same
trouble in the seventeenth digit, so double precision isnt a panacea."
22080,"We need a
strategy to minimize numerical trouble as well as some guidance about how far
we can trust the reported solutions.
"
22081,"A basic improvement on the naive code above is to not determine the factor
to use for row combinations by simply taking the entry in the row,row position,
but rather to look at all of the entries in t"
22082,"This is partial pivoting.
"
22083,"For example, to solve the troublesome system () above we start by looking
at both equations for a best entry to use, and take the 1 in the second equation
as more likely to give good results."
22084,"The combination step of .0012 + 1
gives a rst equation of 1.001y = 1, which the computer will represent as
(1.0  100)y = 1.0  100, leading to the conclusion that y = 1 and, after back-

"
22121,"The second electrical fact is that in some kinds of network components the
amount of ow is proportional to the force provided by the battery."
22122,"That is, for
each such component there is a number, its resistance, such that the potential

a line through the origin, are resistors."
22125,"(Not every component has this property.

Vector Spaces
The rst chapter nished with a fair understanding of how Gausss Method
solves a linear system."
22202,"It systematically takes linear combinations of the rows.
"
22203,"Here we move to a general study of linear combinations.
"
22204,We need a setting.
22205,"At times in the rst chapter weve combined vectors from
R2, at other times vectors from R3, and at other times vectors from higher-
dimensional spaces."
22206,"So our rst impulse might be to work in Rn, leaving n
unspecied."
22207,"This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold
for R2 and for R3 and for many other spaces, simultaneously.
"
22208,"But if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then
sticking only to Rns is restrictive."
22209,"Wed like our results to apply to combinations
of row vectors, as in the nal section of the rst chapter."
22210,"Weve even seen some
spaces that are not simply a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or
row vectors."
22211,"For instance, weve seen a homogeneous systems solution set that
is a plane inside of R3."
22212,"This set is a closed system in that a linear combination
of these solutions is also a solution."
22213,"But it does not contain all of the three-tall
column vectors, only some of them.
"
22214,"We want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear
combinations make sense."
22215,We shall call any such set a vector space.
22216,"Our results,
instead of being phrased as Whenever we have a collection in which we can
sensibly take linear combinations . . ."
22217,", will be stated In any vector space . . ."
22218,"Such a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces.
"
22219,"To
understand the advantages of moving from studying a single space to studying
a class of spaces, consider this analogy."
22220,"Imagine that the government made
laws one person at a time: Leslie Jones cant jay walk."

statements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once.

Another answer is perhaps more satisfying."
22402,"People in this area have worked
to develop the right balance of power and generality."
22403,"This denition is shaped
so that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and
important properties of spaces of linear combinations."
22404,"As we proceed, we shall
derive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the
conditions given in the denition.
"
22405,The next result is an example.
22406,"We do not need to include these properties
in the denition of vector space because they follow from the properties already
listed there.

22416,"A recap: our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider
collections of linear combinations."

space to be a structure in which we can form such combinations, subject to
simple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations."
22418,"In a
phrase: vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.

the study of linear systems."

spaces in the study of linear systems as we instead have linear systems start us
on the study of vector spaces."

As above, weve described the subspace as a collection of unrestricted linear
combinations."
22583,"To show it is a subspace, note that a linear combination of vectors
from L is a linear combination of linear combinations and so statement (2) is
true.
"
22584,"2.13 Denition The span (or linear closure) of a nonempty subset S of a vector
space is the set of all linear combinations of vectors from S.

"
22589,No notation for the span is completely standard.
22590,"The square brackets used here
are common but so are span(S) and sp(S).
"
22591,"2.14 Remark In Chapter One, after we showed that we can write the solution
set of a homogeneous linear system as {c11 +    + ckk | c1, . . ."

22593,"We now call that the span of

22594,"Recall also from that proof that the span of the empty set is dened to
be the set {0} because of the convention that a trivial linear combination, a
combination of zero-many vectors, adds to 0."
22595,"Besides, dening the empty sets

22602,"QED
The converse of the lemma holds: any subspace is the span of some set,
because a subspace is obviously the span of itself, the set of all of its members.
"
22603,Thus a subset of a vector space is a subspace if and only if it is a span.
22604,"This
ts the intuition that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection in
which linear combinations are sensible.
"
22605,"Taken together, Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 2.15 show that the span of a subset
S of a vector space is the smallest subspace containing all of the members of S.
"
22606,"In any vector space V, for any vector v V, the set {r v | r R}
is a subspace of V. For instance, for any vector v R3 the line through the
origin containing that vector {kv | k R} is a subspace of R3."
22607,"This is true even
if v is the zero vector, in which case it is the degenerate line, the trivial subspace.

We know that the span is some subspace of R2."
22611,"To check that it is all of R2 we
must show that any member of R2 is a linear combination of these two vectors.

22617,"This shows
that for any x, y there are appropriate coecients c1, c2 making () true  we
can write any element of R2 as a linear combination of the two given ones."
22618,"For
instance, for x = 1 and y = 2 the coecients c2 = 1/2 and c1 = 3/2 will do.
"
22619,"Since spans are subspaces, and we know that a good way to understand a
subspace is to parametrize its description, we can try to understand a sets span
in that way.
"
22620,"2.18 Example Consider, in the vector space of quadratic polynomials P2, the
span of the set S = {3x x2, 2x}."
22621,"By the denition of span, it is the set of

Chapter Two."
22622,"Vector Spaces
unrestricted linear combinations of the two {c1(3x x2)"
22623,"+ c2(2x) | c1, c2 R}.
"
22624,Clearly polynomials in this span must have a constant term of zero.
22625,"Is that
necessary condition also sucient?
"
22626,We are asking: for which members a2x2
22627,"a1x + a0 of P2 are there c1 and c2
such that a2x2"
22628,+ a0 = c1(3x x2)
22629,"Polynomials are equal when
their coecients are equal so we want conditions on a2, a1, and a0 making that
triple a solution of this system.
"
22630,"c1
= a2
3c1 + 2c2 = a1
0 = a0
Gausss Method and back-substitution gives c1 = a2, and c2 = (3/2)a2 +
(1/2)a1, and 0 = a0."
22631,"Thus as long as there is no constant term a0 = 0 we can
give coecients c1 and c2 to describe that polynomial as an element of the
span."
22632,"For instance, for the polynomial 0 4x + 3x2, the coecients c1 = 3 and
c2 = 5/2 will do."
22633,"So the span of the given set is [S] = {a1x + a2x2 | a1, a2 R}.
"
22634,"Incidentally, this shows that the set {x, x2} spans the same subspace."
22635,"A space
can have more than one spanning set."
22636,"Two other sets spanning this subspace
are {x, x2, x + 2x2 } and {x, x + x2, x + 2x2, . . ."
22637,"2.19 Example The picture below shows the subspaces of R3 that we now know
of: the trivial subspace, lines through the origin, planes through the origin, and
the whole space."
22638,"(Of course, the picture shows only a few of the innitely many
cases."
22639,Line segments connect subsets with their supersets.)
22640,"In the next section
we will prove that R3 has no other kind of subspace, so in fact this lists them all.
"
22641,"This describes each subspace as the span of a set with a minimal number
of members."
22642,"With this, the subspaces fall naturally into levels  planes on one
level, lines on another, etc.

Linear Independence
The prior section shows how to understand a vector space as a span, as an
unrestricted linear combination of some of its elements."
22739,"For example, the space
of linear polynomials {a + bx | a, b R} is spanned by the set {1, x}."
22740,"The prior
section also showed that a space can have many sets that span it."
22741,"Two more
sets that span the space of linear polynomials are {1, 2x} and {1, x, 2x}.
"
22742,"At the end of that section we described some spanning sets as minimal
but we never precisely dened that word."
22743,"We could mean that a spanning
set is minimal if it contains the smallest number of members of any set with
the same span, so that {1, x, 2x} is not minimal because it has three members
while we can gi"
22744,"Or we could mean
that a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements that we can remove
without changing the span."
22745,"Under this meaning {1, x, 2x} is not minimal because
removing the 2x to get {1, x} leaves the span unchanged.
"
22746,"The rst sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, in that
to check if a spanning set is minimal we seemingly must look at all the sets
that span and nd one with the least number of eleme"
22747,"The second sense
of minimality is local since we need to look only at the set and consider the
span with and without various elements."
22748,"For instance, using the second sense
we could compare the span of {1, x, 2x} with the span of {1, x} and note that 2x
is a repeat in that its removal doesnt shrink the span.
"
22749,"In this section we will use the second sense of minimal spanning set because
of this technical convenience."

Consider the row space and the column space of this result.
"
23372,"The rst point made earlier in this subsection says that to get a basis for the
row space we can just collect the rows with leading entries."
23373,"However, because
this is in reduced echelon form, a basis for the column space is just as easy: collect
the columns containing the leading entries, e1,e2. Thus, for a reduced echelon

same way, by taking the parts of the matrix, the rows or columns, containing
the leading entries.
"
23375,"3.11 Theorem For any matrix, the row rank and column rank are equal.
"
23376,Proof Bring the matrix to reduced echelon form.
23377,"Then the row rank equals
the number of leading entries since that equals the number of nonzero rows.
"
23378,"Then also, the number of leading entries equals the column rank because the
set of columns containing leading entries consists of some of the eis from a
standard basis, and that set is linearly indepe"
23379,"Hence, in the reduced echelon form matrix, the row rank equals the column
rank, because each equals the number of leading entries.
"
23380,"But Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.10 show that the row rank and column rank
are not changed by using row operations to get to reduced echelon form."

the row rank and the column rank of the original matrix are also equal.

3.12 Denition The rank of a matrix is its row rank or column rank.
"
23383,"So the second point that we have made in this subsection is that the column

Combining Subspaces
This subsection is optional.
"
23435,"It is required only for the last sections of
Chapter Three and Chapter Five and for occasional exercises."
23436,"You can
pass it over without loss of continuity.
"
23437,"One way to understand something is to see how to build it from component
parts."
23438,"For instance, we sometimes think of R3 put together from the x-axis,
the y-axis, and z-axis."
23439,"In this subsection we will describe how to decompose a
vector space into a combination of some of its subspaces."
23440,"In developing this idea
of subspace combination, we will keep the R3 example in mind as a prototype.
"
23441,Subspaces are subsets and sets combine via union.
23442,"But taking the combination
operation for subspaces to be the simple set union operation isnt what we want.
"
23443,"For instance, the union of the x-axis, the y-axis, and z-axis is not all of R3."
23444,"In
fact this union is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition"

23446,"Therefore to combine
subspaces, in addition to the members of those subspaces, we must at least also
include all of their linear combinations.

let L be the subspace of linear polynomials {a + bx | a, b R} and let C be the
subspace of purely-cubic polynomials {cx3 | c R}."

at least one interesting property of our benchmark model that is not captured by
the denition of the sum of subspaces."
23465,"In the familiar decomposition of R3, we

W2 if and only if it is the sum of the two V = W1 + W2 and their intersection
is trivial W1 W2"
23541,"= {0 }.
"
23542,Proof Suppose rst that V = W1 W2.
23543,"By denition, V is the sum of the
two V = W1 + W2."
23544,"To show that their intersection is trivial let v be a vector
from W1 W2 and consider the equation v = v."
23545,"On that equations left side is
a member of W1 and on the right is a member of W2, which we can think of as
a linear combination of members of W2."
23546,"But the two spaces are independent so
the only way that a member of W1 can be a linear combination of vectors from
W2 is if that member is the zero vector v = 0.
"
23547,"For the other direction, suppose that V is the sum of two spaces with a
trivial intersection."
23548,"To show that V is a direct sum of the two we need only
show that the spaces are independent  that no nonzero member of the rst is
expressible as a linear combination of members of the second, and vice"
23549,"This holds because any relationship w1 = c1w2,1 +    + ckw2,k (with w1 W1
and w2,j W2 for all j) shows that the vector on the left is also in W2, since
the right side is a combination of members of W2"

spaces is trivial, so w1 = 0."

pair for R2 are the subspaces consisting of the lines y = x and y = 2x.

1 Here is a reasonable way in which a voter could have a cyclic preference."
23807,"Suppose
that this voter ranks each candidate on each of three criteria.
"
23808,"(a) Draw up a table with the rows labeled Democrat, Republican, and Third,
and the columns labeled character, experience, and policies."
23809,"Inside each
column, rank some candidate as most preferred, rank another as in the middle,

"

(c) Does the table that was just constructed have a cyclic preference order?"

"
23813,So it is possible for a voter to have a cyclic preference among candidates.

You cant add apples and oranges, the old saying goes."

We can take the idea of including the units beyond bookkeeping."
23833,"We can use
units to draw conclusions about what relationships are possible among the
physical quantities.
"
23834,"To start, consider the falling body equation distance = 16  (time)2."
23835,"If the
distance is in feet and the time is in seconds then this is a true statement.
"
23836,"However it is not correct in other unit systems, such as meters and seconds,
because 16 isnt the right constant in those systems."
23837,"We can x that by attaching
units to the 16, making it a dimensional constant.
"
23838,"dist = 16

Now the equation holds also in the meter-second system because when we align
the units (a foot is approximately 0.30 meters),
distance in meters = 16 0.30 m

 (time in s"
23839,"So in order to have equations that are correct across
unit systems, we restrict our attention to those that use dimensional constants.
"
23840,"Such an equation is complete.
"
23841,"Moving away from a particular unit system allows us to just measure quan-
tities in combinations of some units of length L, mass M, and time T. These
three are our physical dimensions."
23842,"For instance, we could measure velocity in
feet/second or fathoms/hour but at all events it involves a unit of length divided
by a unit of time so the dimensional formula of velocity is L/T. Similarly"
23843,"Vector Spaces
To write the dimensional formula we shall use negative exponents instead of
fractions and we shall include the dimensions with a zero exponent."
23844,"Thus we
will write the dimensional formula of velocity as L1M0T 1 and that of density
as L3M1T 0.
"
23845,"With that, you cant add apples and oranges becomes the advice to check
that all of an equations terms have the same dimensional formula."
23846,"An example
is this version of the falling body equation dgt2 = 0."
23847,"The dimensional formula
of the d term is L1M0T 0."
23848,"For the other term, the dimensional formula of g
is L1M0T 2 (g is given above as 16 ft/sec2) and the dimensional formula of t
is L0M0T 1"
23849,"so that of the entire gt2 term is L1M0T 2(L0M0T 1)2 = L1M0T 0.

property is dimensionally homogeneous.

23854,"The classic example of using the units for more than bookkeeping, using
them to draw conclusions, considers the formula for the period of a pendulum.
"
23855,"p = some expression involving the length of the string, etc.
"
23856,The period is in units of time L0M0T 1.
23857,"So the quantities on the other side of
the equation must have dimensional formulas that combine in such a way that
their Ls and Ms cancel and only a single T remains."
23858,"The table on page 167 has
the quantities that an experienced investigator would consider possibly relevant
to the period of a pendulum."
23859,"The only dimensional formulas involving L are for
the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity."
23860,"For the Ls of these
two to cancel when they appear in the equation they must be in ratio, e.g., as
(/g)2, or as cos(/g), or as (/g)1."
23861,"Therefore the period is a function of /g.
"
23862,"This is a remarkable result: with a pencil and paper analysis, before we ever
took out the pendulum and made measurements, we have determined something
about what makes up its period.
"
23863,"To do dimensional analysis systematically, we need two facts (arguments
for these are in [Bridgman], Chapter II and IV)."

1.3 Denition An isomorphism between two vector spaces V and W is a map
f: V W that
(1) is a correspondence: f is one-to-one and"
23995,"and if v V and r R then
f(rv) = rf(v)
(we write V = W, read V is isomorphic to W, when such a map exists).
"
23996,"Morphism means map, so isomorphism means a map expressing sameness.

underlying the spaces.

Checking that these are automorphisms is Exercise 33.
"
24061,"1.9 Example Consider the space P5 of polynomials of degree 5 or less and the
map f that sends a polynomial p(x) to p(x 1)."
24062,"For instance, under this map
x2 7(x1)2 = x2 2x+1 and x3 +2x 7(x1)3 +2(x1) = x3 3x2 +5x3.
"
24063,"This map is an automorphism of this space; the check is Exercise 25.
"
24064,"This isomorphism of P5 with itself does more than just tell us that the space
is the same as itself."
24065,It gives us some insight into the spaces structure.
24066,"Below
is a family of parabolas, graphs of members of P5."
24067,"Each has a vertex at y = 1,

Substitution of x 1 for x in any functions argument shifts its graph"

to the right by one."
24069,"Notice that the picture before f is applied is the same as
the picture after f is applied because while each parabola moves to the right,
another one comes in from the left to take its place."
24070,"This also holds true for
cubics, etc."

24072,"= 1, then the two pictures
would be indistinguishable.
"
24073,"As described in the opening to this section, having given the denition of
isomorphism, we next look to support the thesis that it captures our intuition of
vector spaces being the same."
24074,"First, the denition itself is persuasive: a vector
space consists of a set and some structure and the denition simply requires that
the sets correspond and that the structures correspond also."
24075,"Also persuasive
are the examples above, such as Example 1.1, which dramatize that isomorphic
spaces are the same in all relevant respects."
24076,"Sometimes people say, where V = W,
that W is just V painted green  dierences are merely cosmetic.
"
24077,"The results below further support our contention that under an isomorphism
all the things of interest in the two vector spaces correspond.
"
24078,"Because we
introduced vector spaces to study linear combinations, of interest means
pertaining to linear combinations."
24079,"Not of interest is the way that the vectors
are presented typographically (or their color!).

24087,So assume statement (1).
24088,"We will prove (3) by
induction on the number of summands n.
The one-summand base case, that f(cv1) = c f(v1), is covered by the second
clause of statement (1).

2.2 Theorem Isomorphism is an equivalence relation between vector spaces.
"
24187,"Proof We must prove that the relation is symmetric, reexive, and transitive.
"
24188,"To check reexivity, that any space is isomorphic to itself, consider the
identity map."

Symmetry, that if V is isomorphic to W then also W is isomorphic to V,
holds by Lemma 2.1 since each isomorphism map from V to W is paired with
an isomorphism from W to V.
"
24194,"To nish we must check transitivity, that if V is isomorphic to W and W
is isomorphic to U then V is isomorphic to U. Let f: V W and g: W U
be isomorphisms."

The prior section shows that a linear map is determined by its action on a basis.
"
24770,"The equation
h(v) = h(c1  1 +    + cn  n) = c1  h(1)"
24771,"+    + cn  h(n)
describes how we get the value of the map on any vector v by starting from the
value of the map on the vectors i in a basis and extending linearly.
"
24772,"This section gives a convenient scheme based on matrices to use the represen-
tations of h(1), . ."
24773,", h(n) to compute, from the representation of a vector in
the domain RepB(v), the representation of that vectors image in the codomain

Matrix Operations

25136,The prior section shows how matrices represent linear maps.
25137,"We now explore
how this representation interacts with things that we already know."
25138,"First we
will see how the representation of a scalar product r  f of a linear map relates to
the representation of f, and also how the representation of a sum f + g relates to
the representations of t"
25139,"Later we will do the same comparison
for the map operations of composition and inverse.

25145,"Where the codomains basis is D = 1,2, that representation gives that the
output vector is w = w11 + w22.
"
25146,"The action of the map 5f is v 75w and 5w = 5  (w11 + w22) =
(5w1)1 + (5w2)2."
25147,"So 5f associates the input vector v with the output vector

Except for the lack of commutativity, matrix multiplication is algebraically
well-behaved.

2.12 Theorem If F, G, and H are matrices, and the matrix products are dened,
then the product is associative (FG"
25299,"and (G + H)F = GF + HF.
Proof Associativity holds because matrix multiplication represents function
composition, which is associative: the maps (f g) h and f (g h) are equal
as both send v to f(g(h(v)"
25300,Distributivity is similar.
25301,"For instance, the rst one goes f (g + h) (v) =
f

25570,So a function can have a right inverse
25571,"but no left inverse, or a left inverse
but no right inverse."
25572,"A function can also fail to have an inverse on either side;
one example is the zero transformation on R2.
"
25573,"Some functions have a two-sided inverse, another function that is the inverse
both from the left and from the right."
25574,"For instance, the transformation given by
v 72  v has the two-sided inverse v 7(1/2)  v."
25575,"The appendix shows that a
function has a two-sided inverse if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
"
25576,"The appendix also shows that if a function f has a two-sided inverse then it is
unique, so we call it the inverse and write f1.
"
25577,"In addition, recall that we have shown in Theorem II.2.20 that if a linear
map has a two-sided inverse then that inverse is also linear.
"
25578,"Thus, our goal in this subsection is, where a linear h has an inverse, to nd
the relationship between RepB,D(h) and RepD,B(h1).

26511,"The rst n rows of the
matrix of coecients add to the same vector as the second n rows, the vector of
all ones."
26512,So a maximal linearly independent must omit at least one row.
26513,"We will
show that the set of all rows but the rst {2 . . ."
26514,"2n+2} is linearly independent.

26516,"+ c2n+22n+2 = 0

"
26517,Now it gets messy.
26518,Focus on the lower left of the tables.
26519,"Observe that in the
nal two rows, in the rst n columns, is a subrow that is all zeros except that it
starts with a one in column 1 and a subrow that is all zeros except that it ends
with a one in colu"
26520,"First, with 1 omitted, both column 1 and column n contain only two ones.
"
26521,"Since the only rows in () with nonzero column 1 entries are rows n+1 and
2n+1, which have ones, we must have c2n+1 = cn+1."
26522,"Likewise considering
the n-th entries of the vectors in () gives that c2n+2 = c2n.
"
26523,"Next consider the columns between those two  in the n = 3 table this
includes only column 2 while in the n = 4 table it includes both columns 2
and 3."
26524,Each such column has a single one.
26525,"That is, for each column index
j {2 . . ."
26526,"2} the column consists of only zeros except for a one in row n + j,
and hence cn+j = 0.
"
26527,"On to the next block of columns, from n + 1 through 2n."
26528,"Column n + 1 has
only two ones (because n 3 the ones in the last two rows do not fall in the rst
column of this block)."
26529,Thus c2 = cn+1 and therefore c2 = c2n+1.
26530,"Likewise,
from column 2n we conclude that c2 = c2n and so c2 = c2n+2.
"
26531,"Because n 3 there is at least one column between column n + 1 and
column 2n 1."
26532,In at least one of those columns a one appears in 2n+1.
26533,"If a one
also appears in that column in 2n+2 then we have c2 = (c2n+1 +c2n+2) since

Chapter Three."
26534,"Maps Between Spaces
cn+j = 0 for j {2 . . ."
26535,"If a one does not appear in that column in 2n+2
then we have c2 = c2n+1."
26536,"In either case c2 = 0, and thus c2n+1 = c2n+2 = 0
and cn+1 = c2n = 0.
"
26537,"If the next block of n-many columns is not the last then similarly conclude
from its rst column that c3 = cn+1 = 0.
"
26538,"Keep this up until we reach the last block of columns, those numbered
(n 1)n + 1 through n2."
26539,"Because cn+1 =    = c2n = 0 column n2 gives that
cn = c2n+1"

26688,"That will
follow immediately from this statement: a map t that is distance-preserving

to understand distance-preserving linear maps.

that they have length one).

Determinants
In the rst chapter we highlighted the special case of linear systems with the
same number of equations as unknowns, those of the form Tx = b where T is a
square matrix."
26774,We noted that there are only two kinds of Ts.
26775,"If T is associated
with a unique solution for any b, such as for the homogeneous system Tx = 0,
then T is associated with a unique solution for every such b."
26776,"We call such a
matrix nonsingular."
26777,"The other kind of T, where every linear system for which it
is the matrix of coecients has either no solution or innitely many solutions,
we call singular.
"
26778,In our work since then this distinction has been a theme.
26779,"For instance, we
now know that an nn matrix T is nonsingular if and only if each of these holds:
 any system Tx = b has a solution and that solution is unique;
 Gauss-Jordan reduction of T yields an i"
26780,"So when we look at a square matrix, one of the rst things that we ask is whether
it is nonsingular.
"
26781,"This chapter develops a formula that determines whether T is nonsingular.
"
26782,"More precisely, we will develop a formula for 11 matrices, one for 22 matrices,
etc."
26783,"These are naturally related; that is, we will develop a family of formulas, a
scheme that describes the formula for each size.

that the 11 term a has one letter, that the 22 terms ad and bc have two
letters, and that the 33 terms each have three letters."

in those terms there is a letter from each row and column of the matrix, e.g., in
the cdh term one letter comes from each row and from each column.

A good strategy for solving problems is to explore which properties the

26805,"So we
shall start by asking what properties wed like the determinant formulas to have.

to do Gaussian reduction and then check whether the diagonal of the echelon

26809,"In the rest of this subsection
we will test this plan against the 22 and 33 formulas."
26810,"In the end we will
have to modify the unaected by row operations part, but not by much.

26813,"= a(kb + d) (ka + c)b = ad bc

worked out the 44 determinant formula and tested it then we might have found
that it is aected by row combinations."
26820,"This is an exploration and we do not
yet have all the facts."

"
26828,This does not wreck our plan entirely.
26829,"We hope to decide nonsingularity by
considering only whether the formula gives zero, not by considering its sign.
"
26830,"Therefore, instead of expecting determinant formulas to be entirely unaected
by row operations we modify our plan so that on a swap they will change sign.

multiplying a row by a scalar."

Properties of Determinants

each n, the function that such a formula calculates."
26890,"We will dene this function
by a list of properties."
26891,"We will then prove that a function with these properties
exists and is unique, and also describe how to compute it."
26892,"(Because we will
eventually prove this, from the start we will just say det(T) instead of if there
is a unique determinant function then det(T).)
"
26893,"2.1 Denition A nn determinant is a function det: Mnn R such that

26906,"We have listed it for consistency with the Gausss Method

"

Method operation of multiplying a row by k does have it."
26908,"The next result shows
that we do not need that restriction here.
"
26909,2.4 Lemma A matrix with two identical rows has a determinant of zero.
26910,"A matrix
with a zero row has a determinant of zero."
26911,"A matrix is nonsingular if and only
if its determinant is nonzero."
26912,"The determinant of an echelon form matrix is the
product down its diagonal.
"
26913,Proof To verify the rst sentence swap the two equal rows.
26914,"The sign of the
determinant changes but the matrix is the same and so its determinant is the
same."
26915,"Thus the determinant is zero.
"
26916,For the second sentence multiply the zero row by two.
26917,"That doubles the de-
terminant but it also leaves the row unchanged, and hence leaves the determinant
unchanged."
26918,"Thus the determinant must be zero.

A singular T reduces to a T with a zero row; by the second sentence of this
lemma its determinant is zero.
"
26922,The fourth sentence has two cases.
26923,"If the echelon form matrix is singular
then it has a zero row."
26924,"Thus it has a zero on its diagonal and the product down
its diagonal is zero."
26925,"By the third sentence of this result the determinant is zero
and therefore this matrixs determinant equals the product down its diagonal.
"
26926,"If the echelon form matrix is nonsingular then none of its diagonal entries is
zero."
26927,"This means that we can divide by those entries and use condition (3) to
get 1s on the diagonal.

"
26930,"So in this case also, the determinant is the product down the diagonal.
"

That gives us a way to compute the value of a determinant function on a
matrix: do Gaussian reduction, keeping track of any changes of sign caused by
row swaps and any scalars that we factor out, "
26932,"This algorithm is as fast as Gausss
Method and so is practical on all of the matrices that we will see.

That example raises an important point."
26938,"This chapters introduction gives
formulas for 22 and 33 determinants, so we know that they exist, but not for
determinant functions on matrices that are 44 or larger."
26939,"Instead, Denition 2.1
gives properties that a determinant function should have and leads to computing
determinants by Gausss Method.
"
26940,"However, for any matrix we can reduce it to echelon form by Gausss Method
in multiple ways."
26941,"For example, given a reduction we could change it by inserting
a rst step that multiplies the top row by 2 and then a second step that multiplies
it by 1/2."
26942,"So we have to worry that two dierent Gausss Method reductions
could lead to two dierent computed values for the determinant.
"
26943,"That is, we must verify that Denition 2.1 gives a well-dened function."
26944,"The
next two subsections do this, showing that there exists a well-dened function
satisfying the denition.
"
26945,"But rst we show that if there is such a function then there is no more than
one."
26946,"The example above illustrates the idea: we got 5 by following the properties
of the denition."
26947,"So while we have not yet proved that det44 exists, that there
is a function with properties (1)  (4), if such a function satisfying them does
exist then we know what value it gives on the above matrix"
26948,"2.7 Lemma For each n, if there is an nn determinant function then it is unique.
"
26949,"Proof Suppose that there are two functions det1, det2 : Mnn R satisfying
the properties of Denition 2.1 and its consequence Lemma 2.4."

"
27200,"4.4 Lemma A row-swap in a permutation matrix changes the number of inversions

Each of these adjacent swaps changes the number of inversions from odd to even

Thus, in aggregate, the number of inversions changes from even to odd, or from
odd to even.
"
27208,"QED
4.5 Corollary"
27209,"If a permutation matrix has an odd number of inversions then
swapping it to the identity takes an odd number of swaps."
27210,"If it has an even
number of inversions then swapping to the identity takes an even number.
"
27211,Proof The identity matrix has zero inversions.
27212,"To change an odd number to
zero requires an odd number of swaps, and to change an even number to zero
requires an even number of swaps.
"
27213,"QED
4.6 Example"
27214,"The matrix in Example 4.3 can be brought to the identity with one
swap 1 3."
27215,"(So the number of swaps neednt be the same as the number of
inversions, but the oddness or evenness of the two numbers is the same.)
"
27216,"4.7 Denition The signum of a permutation sgn() is 1 if the number of
inversions in  is odd and is +1 if the number of inversions is even.

so sgn(1) = 1 because there are no inversions, while sgn(2) = 1 because
there is one.

we have not considered row operations on permutation matrices other than row
swaps."

27359,"That is, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants
|TS| = |T|  |S|.
"
27360,"The two sentences say the same thing, rst in map terms and then in matrix
terms."
27361,"This is because |t(S)| = |TS|, as both give the size of the box that is
the image of the unit box En under the composition t s, where the maps
are represented with respect to the standard basis."
27362,"We will prove the second
sentence.
"
27363,"Proof First consider the case that T is singular and thus does not have an
inverse."
27364,"Observe that if TS is invertible then there is an M such that (TS)M = I,
so T(SM) = I, and so T is invertible."
27365,"The contrapositive of that observation is
that if T is not invertible then neither is TS  if |T| = 0 then |TS| = 0.
"
27366,Now consider the case that T is nonsingular.
27367,"Any nonsingular matrix factors
into a product of elementary matrices T = E1E2   "
27368,"To nish this argument
we will verify that |ES| = |E|  |S| for all matrices S and elementary matrices E.
"
27369,"The result will then follow because |TS| = |E1    ErS| = |E1|    |Er|  |S| =
|E1    Er| "
27370,"|S| = |T|  |S|.
"
27371,There are three types of elementary matrix.
27372,"We will cover the Mi(k) case;
the Pi,j and Ci,j(k) checks are similar."
27373,"The matrix Mi(k)S equals S except that
row i is multiplied by k. The third condition of determinant functions then
gives that |Mi(k)S| = k  |S|."
27374,"But |Mi(k)| = k, again by the third condition
because Mi(k) is derived from the identity by multiplication of row i by k."

|ES| = |E|  |S| holds for E = Mi(k).

Speed of Calculating Determinants
For large matrices, nding the determinant by using row operations is typically
much faster than using the permutation expansion."
27557,"We make this statement
precise by nding how many operations each method performs.
"
27558,"To compare the speed of two algorithms, we nd for each one how the time
taken grows as the size of its input data set grows."
27559,"For instance, if we increase
the size of the input by a factor of ten does the time taken grow by a factor of
ten, or by a factor of a hundred, or by a factor of a thousand?"
27560,"That is, is the
time taken proportional to the size of the data set, or to the square of that size,
or to the cube of that size, etc.?"
27561,"An algorithm whose time is proportional to the
square is faster than one that takes time proportional to the cube.

27968,"We dene the zero polynomial to have degree .
1.1 Remark Dening the degree of the zero polynomial to be allows the
equation degree(fg) = degree(f) + degree(g) to hold for all polynomials.
"
27969,"Just as integers have a division operation  e.g., 4 goes 5 times into 21 with
remainder 1  so do polynomials.
"
27970,1.2 Theorem (Division Theorem for Polynomials) Let p(x) be a polynomial.

is a non-zero polynomial then there are quotient and remainder polynomials
q(x) and r(x) such that
p(x) = d(x)  q(x) + r(x)

"
27972,"The point of the integer statement 4 goes 5 times into 21 with remainder
1 is that the remainder is less than 4  while 4 goes 5 times, it does not go 6
times."

27978,"1.4 Corollary The remainder when p(x) is divided by x  is the constant
polynomial r(x) = p().
"

27987,= (x ) 
27988,q(x) + p().
27989,"Since  is a root,
p() = 0"

Chapter Five."
28124,"Similarity
To develop a canonical form for representatives of the similarity classes we
naturally build on previous work."
28125,"So, if a similarity class does contain a partial
identity matrix then it should represent that class."
28126,"Beyond that, representatives
should be as simple as possible.
"
28127,"The simplest extension of the partial identity form is diagonal form.

28134,Below we will see how to nd the matrix

"
28138,"The fact that N is not the zero matrix means that it cannot be similar to the
zero matrix, because the zero matrix is similar only to itself."
28139,"Thus if N were to
be similar to a diagonal matrix D then D would have at least one nonzero entry
on its diagonal.
"
28140,"The crucial point is that a power of N is the zero matrix, specically N2 is
the zero matrix."
28141,"This implies that for any map n represented by N with respect
to some B, B, the composition n n is the zero map."
28142,"This in turn implies that
any matrix representing n with respect to some B, B has a square that is the
zero matrix."
28143,"But for any nonzero diagonal matrix D2, the entries of D2 are the
squares of the entries of D, so D2 cannot be the zero matrix."
28144,"Thus N is not
diagonalizable.

Proof First recall that for any map the dimension of its range space plus
the dimension of its null space equals the dimension of its domain."

must rise."

that w = tj+1(v) for some v, then w = tj( t(v) )."

28453,"Next we verify the further property: in the chain the subsets containments
are proper initially, and then from some power k onward the range spaces
are equal.

28454,"We rst show that if any pair of adjacent range spaces in the

range space is a subspace of the one before it."

that its rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of the space, and in particular

t: R(t) R(t) is one-to-one and a composition of one-to-one maps is one-
to-one, so tn : R(t) R(t) is one-to-one."

2.3 Remark Technically there is a dierence between the map t: V V and
the map on the subspace t: R(t) R(t) if the generalized range space is

starting any string."

"
28574,"Now instead suppose that the space has a t-string basis B where all of the

Restated, any nn matrix is similar to one in this form.

elements, 2 and 3, to 0."
28967,"This suggests doing the proof by induction since the
dimension of the range space R(t"
28968,"3) is less than that of the starting space.
"
28969,"Proof We will do induction on n. The n = 1 base case is trivial since any 11
matrix is in Jordan form."

of C1, . . ."
28971,", Cn1 has a Jordan form representation and x t: Cn Cn.
"
28972,"Any transformation has at least one eigenvalue 1 because it has a minimal
polynomial, which has at least one root over the complex numbers.
"
28973,"That
eigenvalue has a nonzero eigenvector v, so that (t 1)(v) = 0."
28974,"Thus the
dimension of N (t 1), the maps nullity, is greater than zero."
28975,"Since the rank
plus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain, the rank of t 1 is strictly
less than n. Write W for the range space R(t 1) and write r for the rank, its
dimension.

the restriction of t 1 to W induces a transformation of W, which we shall also
call t 1."

applies and we get a basis for W consisting of disjoint strings that are associated
with the eigenvalues of t 1 on W."

29022,"That is, for any square matrix there should be one and only
one matrix similar to it that is in Jordan form."
29023,"We could make the theorems
form unique by arranging the Jordan blocks so the eigenvalues are in some
specied order, and then arranging the blocks of subdiagonal ones from longest
to shortest."
29024,"In the examples below, we wont address that.
"
29025,"The examples to follow start with a matrix and calculate a Jordan form
matrix similar to it."
29026,Before those we will make one more point.
29027,"For instance, in
the rst example belos we nd that the eigenvalues are 2 and 6."
29028,"To pick the basis
elements related to 2 we nd the null spaces of t 2, (t 2)2 and (t 2)3."
29029,"That
is, to nd the elements of this examples basis we will look in the generalized null
spaces N(t 2) and N(t 6)."
29030,"But we need to be sure that the calculation
for each map does not aect the calculation for the other.
"
29031,2.10 Denition Let t: V V be a transformation.
29032,"A subspace M V is t
invariant if whenever m M then t(m) M (shorter: t(M) M).
"
29033,"2.11 Lemma A subspace is t invariant if and only if it is t  invariant for all
scalars ."
29034,"In particular, if i, j C are unequal eigenvalues of t then the spaces
N(t i) and R(t i) are t j invariant.
"
29035,"Proof The right-to-left half of the rst sentence is trivial: if the subspace is
t  invariant for all scalars  then taking  = 0 shows that it is t invariant.
"
29036,"For the other half suppose that the subspace is t invariant, so that if m M
then t(m) M, and let  be a scalar."
29037,"The subspace M is closed under linear
combinations and so if t(m) M then t(m)"
29038,"Thus if m M then
(t ) (m) M.
The second sentence follows from the rst."
29039,"The two spaces are ti invariant,
so they are t invariant."
29040,"Applying the rst sentence again gives that they are
also t j invariant.

process not after some xed number of steps, but instead when |vk| diers from

29163,"If that
ratio is much less than one then convergence is fast but if it is only slightly
less than one then convergence can be quite slow."
29164,"Consequently, the method
of powers is not the most commonly used way of nding eigenvalues (although
it is the simplest one, which is why it is here)."

a high PageRank if there are many pages that point t"

29611,n < p
29612,"but they are nonprime).
"
29613,"Equivalent statements
Sometimes, not only does P imply Q but also Q implies P.
Some ways to say this are: P if and only if Q, P iQ, P and Q are logically
equivalent, P is necessary and sucient to give"
29614,"An example is
an integer is divisible by ten if and only if that number ends in 0.
"
29615,"Although in simple arguments a chain like P if and only if R, which holds if
and only if S . . . "
29616,"may be practical, to prove that statements are equivalent we
more often prove the two halves if P then Q and if Q then P separately.
"
29617,"Quantiers
Compare these statements about natural numbers: there is a natural number x
such that x is divisible by x2 is true, while for all natural numbers x, that x is
divisible by x2 is false."
29618,"The prexes there is and for all are quantiers.
"
29619,"For all
The for all prex is the universal quantier, symbolized .
The most straightforward way to prove that a statement holds in all cases is
to prove that it holds in each case."
29620,"Thus to show that every number divisible by
p has its square divisible by p2, take a single number of the form pn and square
it (pn)2 = p2n2."
29621,This is a typical element proof.
29622,"(In this kind of argument
be careful not to assume properties for that element other than the ones in the

A-3
hypothesis."
29623,"This argument is wrong: If n is divisible by a prime, say 2, so that
n = 2k for some natural number k, then n2 = (2k)2 = 4k2 and the square of n
is divisible by the square of the prime."
29624,"That is a proof for the special case p = 2
but it isnt a proof for all p."
29625,"Contrast it with a correct one: If n is divisible
by a prime"
29626,"so that n = pk for some natural number k then n2 = (pk)2 = p2k2
and so the square of n is divisible by the square of the prime.)
"
29627,"There exists
The there exists prex is the existential quantier, symbolized .
"
29628,"We can prove an existence proposition by producing something satisfying
the property: for instance, to settle the question of primality of 225"
29629,"+ 1, Euler
exhibited the divisor 641[Sandifer]."
29630,"But there are proofs showing that something
exists without saying how to nd it; Euclids argument given in the next
subsection shows there are innitely many primes without giving a formula
naming them."
29631,"Finally, after Are there any? we often ask How many?
That is, the
question of uniqueness often arises in conjunction with the question of existence.
"
29632,"Sometimes the two arguments are simpler if separated so note that just as
proving something exists does not show that it is unique, neither does proving
that something is unique show that it exists.
"
29633,"Techniques of Proof
We have many ways to prove mathematical statements."
29634,"Here we will outline
two techniques that we use often, and that might not come naturally, even to a
person with a technical turn of mind.
"
29635,"Induction
Many proofs are iterative, Heres why the statement is true for the
number 0, it then follows for 1 and from there to 2 . . ."
29636,"These are proofs by
mathematical induction."
29637,"We will see two examples.
"
29638,We will rst prove that 1 + 2 + 3 +    + n = n(n + 1)/2.
29639,"That formula has
a natural number variable n that is free, meaning that setting n to be 1, or
2, etc., gives a family of cases of the statement: rst that 1 = 1(2)/2, second
that 1 + 2 = 2(3)/2, etc."
29640,"Our induction proofs involve statements with one free
natural number variable.
"
29641,Each such proof has two steps.
29642,"In the base step we show that the statement
holds for some intial number"
29643,"Often this step is a routine verication.
"
29644,"The second step, the inductive step, is more subtle; we will show that this
implication holds:
"
29645,"If the statement holds from n = i up to and including n = k
then the statement holds also in the n = k + 1 case
()
(the rst line is the inductive hypothesis)."
29646,"Completing both steps proves that
the statement is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal to i.

A-4
"
29647,"For the sum of the initial n numbers statement the intuition behind the
principle is that rst, the base step directly veries the statement for the case
of the initial number n = 1."
29648,"Then, because the inductive step veries the
implication () for all k, that implication applied to k = 1 gives that the
statement is true for the case of the number n = 2."
29649,"Now, with the statement
established for both 1 and 2, apply () again to conclude that the statement is
true for the number n = 3."
29650,"In this way, we bootstrap to all numbers n 1.
"
29651,"Here is a proof of 1 + 2 + 3 +    + n = n(n + 1)/2, with separate paragraphs
for the base step and the inductive step.
"
29652,For the base step we show that the formula holds when n = 1.
29653,"Thats
easy; the sum of the rst 1 natural number equals 1(1 + 1)/2.
"
29654,"For the inductive step, assume the inductive hypothesis that the formula
holds for the numbers n = 1, n = 2, . ."
29655,", n = k with k 1."
29656,"That is,
assume 1 = 1(1)/2, and 1 + 2 = 2(3)/2, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 3(4)/2, through
1 + 2 +   "
29657,+ k = k(k + 1)/2.
29658,"With that, the formula holds also in the
n = k + 1 case:
1 + 2 +   "
29659,"+ (k + 1) = k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
(the rst equality follows from the inductive hypothesis).
"
29660,"Here is another example, proving that every integer greater than or equal to
2 is a product of primes.
"
29661,"The base step is easy: 2 is the product of a single prime.
"
29662,"For the inductive step assume that each of 2, 3, . . ."
29663,", k is a product of primes,
aiming to show k+1 is also a product of primes."
29664,"There are two possibilities.
"
29665,"First, if k + 1 is not divisible by a number smaller than itself then it is a
prime and so is the product of primes."
29666,The second possibility is that k
29667,"+ 1
is divisible by a number smaller than itself, and then by the inductive
hypothesis its factors can be written as a product of primes."
29668,"In either case
k + 1 can be rewritten as a product of primes.
"
29669,"Contradiction
Another technique of proof is to show that something is true by
showing that it cannot be false."
29670,"A proof by contradiction assumes that the
proposition is false and derives some contradiction to known facts.
"
29671,"The classic example of proof by contradiction is Euclids argument that there
are innitely many primes.
"
29672,"Suppose that there are only nitely many primes p1, . . ."
29673,"Consider the
number p1 p2 . . ."
29674,"None of the primes on the supposedly exhaustive
list divides this number evenly since each leaves a remainder of 1."
29675,"But
every number is a product of primes so this cant be."
29676,"Therefore there
cannot be only nitely many primes.

"
29677,"A-5
Another example is this proof that

2 is not a rational number.
"
29678,"Suppose that

2 = m/n, so that 2n2 = m2."
29679,"Factor out any 2s, giving
n = 2kn  n and m = 2km  m."
29680,"2  (2kn  n)2 = (2km  m)2
The Prime Factorization Theorem says that there must be the same number
of factors of 2 on both sides, but there are an odd number of them"
29681,"+ 2kn
on the left and an even number 2km on the right."
29682,"Thats a contradiction,
so a rational number with a square of 2 is impossible.
"
29683,"Sets, Functions, and Relations
The material here forms the backdrop, the vocabulary, for all of the development
that we do.
"
29684,Sets Mathematicians often work with collections.
29685,"The most commonly-used kind
of collection is a set."
29686,"Sets are characterized by the Principle of Extensionality:
two sets with the same elements are equal."
29687,"Because of this, the order of the
elements does not matter {2, } = {, 2}, and repeats collapse {7, 7} = {7}.
"
29688,"We can describe a set using a listing between curly braces {1, 4, 9, 16} (as
in the prior paragraph), or by using set-builder notation {x | x5 3x3 + 2 = 0}
(read the set of all x such that . . ."
29689,"We name sets with capital roman letters;
for instance the set of primes is P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . ."
29690,"(except that a few sets
are so important that their names are reserved, such as the real numbers R and
the complex numbers C)."
29691,"To denote that something is an element, or member,)
of a set we use , so that 7 {3, 5, 7} while 8 {3, 5, 7}.
"
29692,"We say that A is a subset of B, written A B, when x A implies that
x B."
29693,"In this book we use  for the proper subset relationship that A is a
subset of B but A = B (some authors use this symbol for any kind of subset,
proper or not)."
29694,"An example is {2, } {2, , 7}."
29695,"These symbols may be ipped,
for instance {2, , 5} {2, 5}.
"
29696,"Because of Extensionality, to prove that two sets are equal A = B show that
they have the same members."
29697,"Often we do this by showing mutual inclusion,
that both A B and A B. Such a proof will have a part showing that if
x A then x B, and a second part showing that if x B then x A.
When a set has no membe"
29698,"Diagrams
We picture basic set operations with a Venn diagram."
29699,"This shows
x P.

A-6
P
x
The outer rectangle contains the universe of all objects under discussion."
29700,"For
instance, in a statement about real numbers, the rectangle encloses all members
of R. The set is pictured as a circle, enclosing its members.
"
29701,Here is the diagram for P Q.
29702,"It shows that if x P then x Q.

Multisets As described above, a set is a collection in which order does not matter,
so that the sets {2, } and {, 2} are equal, and in which repe"
29708,"A-7
A collection that is like a set in that order does not matter, but in which
repeats do not collapse, is a multiset."
29709,"(Note that we use the same curly brackets
notation {. . ."
29710,as for sets.)
29711,"Thus the multiset {1, 2, 2} diers from the multiset
{1, 2}."
29712,"Because order does not matter, these multisets are all equal: {1, 2, 2},
{2, 1, 2}, and {2, 2, 1}."
29713,"In this text we only mention multisets in a remark so
going into how to do subsets, unions, or intersections, is beyond our scope.
"
29714,"In addition to sets and multisets, we also use collections where order
matters and where repeats do not collapse."
29715,"These are sequences, denoted with
angle brackets: 2, 3, 7= 2, 7, 3. A sequence of length 2 is an ordered pair,
and is often written with parentheses: (, 3)."
29716,"We also sometimes say ordered
triple, ordered 4-tuple, etc."
29717,"The set of ordered n-tuples of elements of a set A
is denoted An."
29718,"Thus R2 is the set of pairs of reals.
"
29719,"Functions
A function or map f: D C is is an association between input
arguments x D and output values f(x) C subject to the the requirement that
the function must be well-dened, that x suces to determ"
29720,"Restated,
the condition is that if x1 = x2 then f(x1) = f(x2).
"
29721,"The set of all arguments D is fs domain and the set of output values is
its range R(f)."
29722,"Often we dont work with the range and instead work with
a convenient superset, the codomain C. For instance, we might describe the
squaring function with s: R R instead of s: R R+ {0}.
"
29723,"We picture functions with a bean diagram.
"
29724,The blob on the left is the domain while on the right is the codomain.
29725,"The
function associates the three points of the domain with three in the codomain.
"
29726,"Note that by the denition of a function every point in the domain is associated
with a unique point in the codomain, but the converse neednt be true.
"
29727,"The association is arbitrary; no formula or algorithm is required, although in
this book there typically is one."
29728,We often use y to denote f(x).
29729,"We also use the
notation x
f
716x2 100, read x maps under f to 16x2 100 or 16x2 100
is the image of x.
"
29730,"A map such as x 7sin(1/x) is a combinations of simpler maps, here g(y) =
sin(y) applied to the image of f(x)"
29731,"The composition of g: Y Z with
f: X Y, is the map sending x X to g( f(x) )"
29732,It is denoted g f: X
29733,"Z.
This denition only makes sense if the range of f is a subset of the domain of g.

A-8
An identity map id:"
29734,"Y Y dened by id(y) = y has the property that for
any f: X Y, the composition id f is equal to f."
29735,"So an identity map plays the
same role with respect to function composition that the number 0 plays in real
number addition or that 1 plays in multiplication.
"
29736,"In line with that analogy, we dene a left inverse of a map f: X Y to be
a function g: range(f) X such that g f is the identity map on X. A right
inverse of f is a h: Y X such that f h is the identity."
29737,For some fs there is a map that is both a left and right inverse of f.
29738,"If such
a map exists then it is unique because if both g1 and g2 have this property
then g1(x) = g1 (f g2) (x) = (g1 f) g2 (x) = g2(x) (the middle equality
comes from the associativity of function com"
29739,"so we call it a two-sided
inverse or just the inverse, and denote it f1."
29740,"For instance, the inverse of
the function f: R R given by f(x) = 2x 3 is the function f1 : R R given
by f1(x) = (x + 3)/2.
"
29741,"The superscript notation for function inverse f1 ts into a larger scheme.
"
29742,"Functions with the same codomain as domain f: X X can be iterated, so that
we can consider the composition of f with itself: f f, and f f f, etc."
29743,"We write
f f as f2 and f f f as f3, etc."
29744,"Note that the familiar exponent rules for real
numbers hold: fi fj = fi+j and (fi)j = fij."
29745,"Then where f is invertible, writing
f1 for the inverse and f2 for the inverse of f2, etc., gives that these familiar
exponent rules continue to hold, since we dene f0 to be the identity map.
"
29746,"The denition of function requires that for every input there is one and only
one associated output value."
29747,"If a function f: D C has the additional property
that for every output value there is at least one associated input value  that is,
the additional property that fs codomain equals its range C = R(f)  "
29748,A function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto.
29749,"(The f pictured above
has a right inverse"
29750,"g: C D given by following the arrows backwards, from
right to left."
29751,"For the codomain point on the top, choose either one of the arrows
to follow."
29752,"With that, applying g rst followed by f takes elements y C to
themselves, and so is the identity function.)
"
29753,"If a function f: D C has the property that for every output value there is
at most one associated input value  that is, if no two arguments share an image
so that f(x1)"
29754,"= f(x2) implies that x1 = x2  then the function is one-to-one.
"
29755,"The bean diagram from earlier illustrates.

"
29756,"A-9
A function has a left inverse if and only if it is one-to-one."
29757,"(In the picture dene
g: C D to follow the arrows backwards for those y C that are at the end of
an arrow, and to send the point to an arbitrary element in D otherwise."
29758,"Then
applying f followed by g to elements of D will act as the identity.)
"
29759,"By the prior paragraphs, a map has a two-sided inverse if and only if that map
is both onto and one-to-one."
29760,Such a function is a correspondence.
29761,"It associates
one and only one element of the domain with each element of the codomain.
"
29762,"Because a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and a composition of
onto maps is onto, a composition of correspondences is a correspondence.
"
29763,We sometimes want to shrink the domain of a function.
29764,"For instance, we
may take the function f: R R given by f(x)"
29765,"and, in order to have an
inverse, limit input arguments to nonnegative reals f: R+ {0} R. Then f is
the restriction of f to the smaller domain.
"
29766,"Relations
Some familiar mathematical things, such as < or =, are most
naturally understood as relations between things."
29767,"A binary relation on a set
A is a set of ordered pairs of elements of A. For example, some elements of
the set that is the relation < on the integers are (3, 5), (3, 7), and (1, 100).
"
29768,"Another binary relation on the integers is equality; this relation is the set
{. . ."
29769,", (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), . . .}."
29770,"Still another example is closer than 10, the set
{(x, y) | |x y| < 10}."
29771,"Some members of this relation are (1, 10), (10, 1), and
(42, 44)."
29772,"Neither (11, 1) nor (1, 11) is a member.
"
29773,"Those examples illustrate the generality of the denition.
"
29774,"All kinds of
relationships (e.g., both numbers even or rst number is the second with the
digits reversed) are covered.
"
29775,"Equivalence Relations
We shall need to express that two objects are alike in
some way."
29776,"They arent identical, but they are related (e.g., two integers that
give the same remainder when divided by 2).
"
29777,"A binary relation {(a, b), . . .} is an equivalence relation when it satises
(1) reexivity: any object is related to itself, (2) symmetry: if a is related
to b then b is related to a, and (3) transiti"
29778,"Partitions
In the same sign relation {(1, 3), (5, 7), (0, 0), . . ."
29779,"there are three

A-10
kinds of pairs, pairs with both numbers positive, pairs with both negative, and
the one pair with both zero."
29780,"So integers fall into exactly one of three classes,
positive, or negative, or zero.
"
29781,"A partition of a set is a collection of subsets {S0, S1, S2, . . .}"
29782,"such that
every element of S is an element of a subset S1 S2    = and overlapping
parts are equal: if Si Sj = then Si = Sj."
29783,"Picture that is decomposed into
non-overlapping parts.

29784,"S0
S1
S2
S3
"
29785,"Thus the prior paragraph says that same sign partitions the integers into the
set of positives, the set of negatives, and the set containing only zero."
29786,"Similarly,
the equivalence relation = partitions the integers into one-element sets.
"
29787,"Another example is the set of strings consisting of a number, followed by
a slash, followed by a nonzero number = {n/d | n, d Z and d = 0}."
29788,"Dene
Sn,d by: n/d Sn,d if nd = nd."
29789,"Checking that this is a partition of is
routine (observe for instance that S4,3 = S8,6)."
29790,"This shows some parts, listing
in each a couple of its innitely many members.
. . .
."
29791,"8/6
Every equivalence relation induces a partition, and every partition is induced
by an equivalence."
29792,(This is routine to check.)
29793,"Below are two examples.
"
29794,"Consider the equivalence relationship between two integers of gives the same
remainder when divided by 2, the set P = {(1, 3), (2, 4), (0, 0), . . .}."
29795,"In the set P
are two kinds of pairs, the pairs with both members even and the pairs with both
members odd."
29796,"This equivalence induces a partition where the parts are found
by: for each x we dene the set of numbers related to it Sx = {y | (x, y) P}.
"
29797,The parts are {. . .
29798,", 3, 1, 1, 3, . . .} and {. . ."
29799,", 2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}."
29800,"Each part can be
named in many ways; for instance, {. . ."
29801,", 3, 1, 1, 3, . . .} is S1 and also is S3.
"
29802,"Now consider the partition of the natural numbers where two numbers are
in the same part if they leave the same remainder when divided by 10, that
is, if they have the same least signicant digit."
29803,"This partition is induced by
the equivalence relation R dened by: two numbers n, m are related if they
are together in the same part."
29804,"For example, 3 is related to 33, but 3 is not

A-11
related to 102."
29805,"Verifying the three conditions in the denition of equivalence
are straightforward.
"
29806,We call each part of a partition an equivalence class.
29807,"We sometimes pick a
single element of each equivalence class to be the class representative.
. . .
"
29808,"



Usually when we pick representatives we have some natural scheme in mind."
29809,"In
that case we call them the canonical representatives."
29810,"An example is that two
fractions 3/5 and 9/15 are equivalent."
29811,"In everyday work we often prefer to use
the simplest form or reduced form fraction 3/5 as the class representative.
